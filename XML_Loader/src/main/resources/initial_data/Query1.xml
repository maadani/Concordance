<Name>Baby Back Ribs</Name>
<Author>Bob Davis</Author>
<Ingredients>Serves/Makes:4-6

Ingredients 
4 racks pork baby back ribs 
3 large white onions 
1 2-liter bottle Canada Dry Ginger Ale 
1 bottle your favorite BBQ sauce (I use Bullseye&apos;s Original).</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Place ribs (bone side down) in shallow baking pan(s). 
Add ginger ale until ribs are completely submerged. 
Cut onions in semi-thick (about 1/4 inch) slices. 
Place onions directly on ribs (3-4 slices per rack) 
Cover pan(s) with aluminum foil and bake at 300degrees for 3 hours. 
Let cool to room temperature (still covered). 
Place ribs on medium-high grill. 
Add bbq sauce to taste. 
Note: Only grill ribs bone side down, no need to turn over. 
The ribs will be so tender they will fall apart if you try 
to turn them. 

</Instructions>
<Serves>6</Serves>
<Notes>You may also use 7-Up vice ginger ale. I prefer ginger ale. I also tried this with country style ribs, it turned out ok, but I prefer baby backs. These will be the best homemade baby back ribs you have ever had! </Notes>

<Author>Barb</Author>
<Ingredients>Serves/Makes:6 to 8


Ingredients 
One pork butt sliced into steaks. 
(This is easy to find in the midwest, but may not be elsewhere.) 
One jar of Italian salad dressing. 
One to Two jars of barbecue sauce, depending on the size. You&apos;ll need approximately 32 ounces. 
1/3 cup (80 ml) Worchestire sauce 
1/2 cup (125 ml) lemon juice 
3/4 cup (175 ml) brown sugar 
1/2 cup (125 ml) sugar 
One Chopped onion (optional) 
garlic or garlic salt (optional) 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Preparation 
Marinate pork steaks overnight or at least 4 hours in Italian salad dressing. 
Barbecue meat over low heat, turning frequently for approximately 2 hours on a grill. 
The meat will separate from the bone slightly when fully cooked. 
Other ingredients should be mixed for barbecue sauce. 
Using a basting brush, apply the sauce and continue cooking over low heat and turning frequently. 
Amount of barbecue sauce to coat with, and additional cooking time is a matter of personal preference. 
I suggest 1/2 to 1 hour additional cooking time for coating with the barbecue sauce.

Comments 
My family actually prefers using Milk Chocolate Chips instead of semi-sweet. The key to making the fudge creamy and keeping it from becoming grainy, is boiling it for the exact time mentioned while stirring constantly. 
This is the same recipe they use at See&apos;s Candy Stores. It is creamy and delicious.

      2 c  Long grain rice
  3 3/4 c  Water
      2 ts Salt
      2 tb Butter or margarine
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>preheat the oven to 350F. Using
  clean hans, mix together the dump ingredients in a large bowl. Mold
  pieces of this mixture into various size/shape dumps.
 
  Place so they don&apos;t touch each other in an un greased baking pan. Use
  two if they don&apos;t all fit. With an adult&apos;s help, bake the dumps for
  about 20 minutes or until they are all brown, firm and slightly
  crusty.
 
  While the meat cooks, put all four litter ingredients into a large
  saucepan. Then, with an adult&apos;s help, heat on high until the water
  comes to a boil. Stir, turn heat to low and cover the pan. Simmer
  without lifting the cover for fourteen minutes.
 
  With an adult&apos;s help, remove the saucepan from the stove and
  carefully (to avoid having your face melted away by the steam), lift
  off the cover. Break apart, or &quot;fluff&quot; the rice with a fork and set
  pan aside.
 
  When dumps are done, carefully transfer them onto paper towels to
  drain.
 
  Spoon the rice and dumps into the now empty baking pan, leaving some
  dumps partially uncovered, the way Kitty does when he/she is in a
  hurry. Serves 8-10 litter box lovers. Use pooper scooper to serve.

Mix the cream cheese, confectionary sugar, and 1 cup (225 ml) of Cool Whip together until well blended and smooth. 
Spread on top of the cooled crust. 
Spread the peanut butter on top of the first layer. 
Mix the chocolate pudding, vanilla pudding and milk (this is how much the boxes of pudding calls for) until thick. 
Spread on top of the second layer. 
Spread Cool Whip on top of the third layer (I usually use what remains of a medium container of Cool Whip ) as you desire. 
If you desire, sprinkle more chopped nuts and cherries onto the top of the dessert. 
Chill. If you want you can eat it right away, but after you cut your slices, place the remaining dessert in the refrigerator so that the Cool Whip won&apos;t melt.

<Author>Sharon Watson</Author>
<Ingredients>Buttermilk Fried Carp Fillets

2 pounds carp fillets
1 cup buttermilk
1 cup biscuit mix or pancake mix
2 teaspoons salt
1/4 teaspoon dried lemon flakes
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Remove the skin of the carp. Take out all the brownish-redish-colored part of the meat, the &quot;mud vein&quot;; discard. Chunk up the rest of the carp fillets. 

Place fillet pieces in a shallow dish. Pour the buttermilk over them and let it stand for half an hour, turning the fillets over once during that time.

Stir the salt into the biscuit mix.

Take fillets out of the buttermilk and pat them into the biscuit mix, covering both sides.

Fry fillets in deep fryer or in hot oil in fry-pan for 5 - 10 minutes until cooked through and browned on both sides. Use tongs or slotted spoon to turn them. (If oil is too hot, they will brown too quickly and not cook within.)

Drain on paper towels.

Serve with lemon wedges if available.

Carp Sandwich:
---------------------

Skin the carp. Remove the redish-brown colored part of the meat: the &quot;mud vein.&quot; Fillet the carp. Score the fillets by cutting about two-thirds into the meat every 1/4 inch. Cut into sandwhich size pieces.

Beat one or more egg. Dip fish pieces into egg, then into salted bread crumbs, or saltine cracker crumbs.

Deep fry or pan fry in lots of oil, after oil is plenty hot (about medium to medium high).

Use your favorite bread or hamburger buns, spread bread with tartar sauce or sandwich spread. 

Place browned and tender fish fillets between the slices. Add whatever garnishes you’d like -- lettuce, tomato...

Comments 
In my family, we served this over big thick slices of fresh homemade bread oven toasted with sweet butter. Now, with diets and nutrition concerns, I serve it over steamed rice. But, every now and then, I just HAVE to have that fresh bread and butter! Note: You can substitute Albacore tuna or other flakey fish if you have leftovers too! Use fish stock or chicken stock for the 1 cup of juice. And, if you use frozen peas, use fish stock or chicken stock to make up the 1 cup of liquid for the missing canned pea liquid.

2 cups (475 ml) non-iodized salt 
6 cups (1425 ml) brown sugar 
6 bay leaves 
1 tbsp (15 ml) whole pepper corns 
4 cups (950 ml) hardwood or fruitwood chips for smoking</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Make Brine: 
Mix salt, brown sugar and spices with 6 quarts (5675 ml) water. (Double, if necessary, to cover) 
Rinse whole turkey after removing giblets and cutting away excess fat. 
Place turkey in clean plastic or glass continer with sufficient size to fill with brine that covers entire turkey. 
Pour brine over turkey to cover. 
Turkey should remain in brine for 12-20 hours (keep refigerated). 
In preparation for cooking, remove turkey from brine and rinse thoroughly to remove surface saltiness. 
Pat dry with paper towels then air dry for about 30 min to form shinny surface that&apos;s dry to the touch. 
Place on heavy duty aluminum foil or cooking pan suitable for outdoor grill. 
Create loose tent of aluminum foil to cover. 
Soak 4 cups (950 ml) wood chips (hickory, mesquite or fruit wood) in water. 
Place about a cup of chips in small pan or on aluminum foil on top of charcoal or gas grill grate over low flame. 
Cook for approximately 30 minutes per pound at 180 200 degrees (90 C.) F. 
Use meat thermometer placed in thigh until 170 degrees (80 C.) F. is reached, test to ensure doneness. 
Add additional wood chips as needed to smoke thoroughly.

<Notes>I use my two burner gas grill to do this recipe. Usually one burner on low will maintain temperature. Place chips over that burner. Charcoal grills can also be used successfully. The aluminum foil tent helps retain mositure. It&apos;s a family tradition to prepare Thanksgiving turkey with this technique and they&apos;ve always been teriffic. I have begun using a meat thermometer to avoid undercooking. Enjoy! </Notes>

<Author>Vicky Bryant</Author>
<Ingredients>Ingredients 
pork, beef or country style ribs (approx. 1/2 lb (.2 kg). per person) 
Equal parts of: 
teriyaki sauce 
pineapple juice 
white wine 
1 small can (depending on how many you are making) pineapple chunks 
Season with: 
1 or more cloves finely diced fresh garlic (or 1/4 tsp (1 ml) ground if you prefer) 
1 slice fresh ginger, minced (1/16&quot; thick or so) (or 1/4 tsp (1 ml) ground if you prefer) 
sliced spring onions - optional 
2 tbsp (30 ml) sesame seeds - optional 
cooked noodles or rice 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Preparation 
Trim excess fat from ribs if necessary 
Mix all liquid ingredients (including pineapple chunks) and all seasonings. 
Marinate ribs for at least 3 hours, all day is better, 24 hours is even better - be sure to rotate ribs periodically or make sure they are all covered. 
Take left-over marinade, with pineapple, and bring to a boil in pot for 10 minutes to make it suitable to use over noodles or rice. 
You can either start these ribs out in the oven at 350 degrees (175 C.) for about 15 minutes then finish on grill, or place on grill at med-low temperature until fully cooked 
You may thicken the marinade with some arrowroot or cornstarch and serve this (with the pineapple chunks) over egg noodles or rice. 
If marinade gets too salty when boiling you may add more pineapple juice and wine and teriyaki if necessary. 
When pouring in wine be sure and remove from stove first. 
Comments 
The pineapple juice is a natural tenderizer so the longer you marinate these the more tender they will be. This marinade is also good for steaks and chicken wings. The wings I marinate for two days to really pack the flavor in.

If you don&apos;t care for anchovies leave them out and add a little salt to taste. If you can&apos;t find anchovy essence, then use 1 t. anchovy paste or minced anchovies. If the lemon is very juicy you might want to only use 1/2. This recipe is great with cooked chicken or shrimp added.

<Name>Crawfish Casserole</Name>
<Author>Dineen Blaylock - Alexandria, LA</Author>
<Ingredients>Ingredients 
1 lb (.5 kg) crawfish tails (fresh or frozen) 
1 can cream of mushroom soup 
1 medium onion (finely chopped) 
1 bell pepper (finely chopped) 
2 ribs celery (finely chopped) 
1 can Rotel tomatoes (diced kind preferably) 
2 tbs (30 ml). Parsley 
stick margarine or butter 
4 8 oz (224 grm). shredded Cheddar cheese 
1 pkg. yellow rice (I prefer Mahatma) 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Preparation 
In a medium-size bowl, mix the crawfish, soup and parsley. Let sit. 
Prepare yellow rice according to the directions on the package. 
While rice it is cooking chop the onion, bell pepper and celery according to your taste. 
Melt the margarine or butter in a skillet. 
Dump in the onion, bell pepper and celery into the skillet and saut until tender. 
Add the can of Rotel tomatoes to the seasoning and simmer for about 5-10 minutes. 
Once the rice is done, add the rice to the mixture in the skillet and stir together well. 
In a large casserole dish (9 x 13 at least), dump in the rice mixture and spread out evenly. 
Spoon the crawfish &amp; soup mixture over the top of the rice until you have evenly covered the rice. 
Then, cover the top with the cheese. 
The amount of cheese depends on your personal preference. 
Bake @ 350 F. for about 30-40 minutes or until the cheese has melted and the casserole is bubbly. 
Comments 
This can be made with shrimp, but you need to use the small shrimp. If you like milder seasoning, you can substitute regular canned tomatoes for the Rotel.

Turn shrimp to baste and grill on both sides. 
Comments 
This is our answer to Monterey Bay Canners or Seafood Broiler. Serve with a buttery rice pilaf and tossed green salad. Marinading shrimp has never been necessary if basted frequently enough while grilling. Use 1/2 size skewers for hors d&apos;oeurve portions.

This pie is actually named the Sotterley Oyster Pye for the historic Sotterly Mansion in Maryland where lavish banquets served the dish. Oyster pie is wonderful-sounds unusual and is but tastes great. Nice with a fruity white wine. Recipe recreated by William Taylor a Maryland caterer and historian.

5 cups (1175 ml) shredded cabbage 
1/2 tsp (2 ml) pepper 
1 tsp (5 ml) salt 
1/2 cup (125 ml) of cream OR evaporated milk 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Preparation 
Put the butter in a skillet and let it start to brown slightly. 
Add the cabbage and stir well; cover the skillet and let simmer for 5 minutes. 
Stir and cook for another 5 minutes. 
Add the salt, pepper and cream (or evaporated milk). 
Cover and simmer 4 more minutes. 
It is very important not to overcook the cabbage. 
Comments 
Note: You can add a touch of nutmeg for a savoury flair. You can also use the salt and pepper to taste. Also, I have used very successfully the substitution of bacon fat for the butter. I have no idea if this really is indigenous to Tennessee or not, but the person who originally gave it to me is from the city of Pulaski, Tennessee.

<Name>Barbecued Smoked Wild Turkey</Name>
<Author>Sharon Watson</Author>
<Ingredients>INGEDIENTS
Bird (wild, domestic or peafowl): 
About 10 - 12 pounds, whole 
(If it&apos;s a wild turkey, it might weigh 15-20 lbs. Just double the ingredients)

Liquid to be injected into the bird:
1/2 teaspoon cayenne
1/2 cup garlic-flavored oil
4 ounces of beer

Paste to be massaged into the bird:
3-4 garlic cloves
1 Tablespoon salt
1 Tablespoon coarse pepper
Pinch of cayenne
1 Tablespoon garlic-flavored oil

Ingredients for basting:
2 cups chicken stock
1 cup water
8 ounces beer
1/4 cup oil; olive oil, canola or corn oil
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>The night before, combine the injection ingredients in a bowl, and suck up into a kitchen syringe. Inject the ingredients deeply into the turkey in numerous places, but mostly into the breast meat. This works especially well for wild birds because it adds internal moisture. It will not make the meat greasy.

To make your own garlic-flavored oil, mince one bulb of garlic, place it in a jar, add enough oil to cover it by a couple of inches. Put a lid on the jar, and refrigerate for at least 24 hours before using.

Combine the paste ingredients until it becomes of a paste consistency. Add the oil after grinding the other ingredients with a mortar and pestle or by some other means. Mix well.

Rub the paste under the skin of the turkey carefully. Rub the paste also inside the cavity. Cover the bird in plastic and place in refrigerator.

The next morning, take the turkey out of the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for an hour to an hour and a half before barbecuing. Get the smoker ready. Bring the temperature up to 200 - 230 degrees F.

Wrap the bird in wet cheesecloth and secure the ends.

Place your turkey breast-side down in the smoker and cook for 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours per pound. The internal temperature should reach 180 degrees F. Re-wet the cheesecloth periodically. It must stay wet.

After the bird cooks from six to ten hours, depending on its size and internal temperature, cut off the cheesecloth and discard.

After the cheesecloth is removed, you can baste the turkey while it finishes its cooking, if your smoking method allows you to baste while the bird remains in the smoker. Combine the basting ingredients and warm up the mixture on low heat, or in a microwave briefly. Baste every half hour if you can.

When your turkey, or other-type bird is done, remove it from the smoker, and let it sit for 15 minutes to a half hour before slicing.

Serve with your favorite store-bought or home-made barbecue sauce!

CAKE ASSEMBLY:
To assemble cake, place 1 layer on a cake plate.  Spread with butter cream   filling.  Using 3/4 cup of the cherries, which have been patted dry, drop   cherries evenly over cream.  Place second layer on cake.  Repeat.  Place   third layer on top.  Fold 2 T confectioners&apos; sugar into the whipped cream.
Cover the sides and top of the cake with whipped cream.  Decorate top of   cake with remaining 1/2 cup cherries.  To make chocolate curls from   chocolate bar, shave (at room temperature) with a vegetable peeler. 
Refrigerate curls until ready to use.  Press chocolate curls on sides of cake and sprinkle a few on the top.  Chill until serving time.

<Ingredients>Makes 3 to 4 servings.

**  Stir Fry Ingredients  **

1/2 pound (250 g) lean beef, pork, chicken, or fish, with bones removed
4-6 cups of fresh vegetables, diced
3   tablespoons peanut oil
1-3 tablespoons of water

 **  Marinade Ingredients  **

1   tablespoon soya sauce
1   tablespoon sherry or saki (rice wine)
1   teaspoon corn starch
1   teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon ground fresh ginger (keeps well in the freezing compartment)

</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1) Mix the Marinade ingredients in a medium size bowl.

2) Cut the meat into thin strips, 1&quot; long. Then soak the strips in the 
marinade for at least 15 minutes.

3) Set the temperature of an electric non-stick wok to 360 F (185 C). Put 
1 tablespoon of oil in the wok, and wait for the wok to heat up. When the 
wok is hot, the red power indicator light will go off.

4) Put the marinated meat in the wok and stir constantly, for a few 
minutes, with a couple of wooden spatulas or spoons. Remove the meat once 
it is brown on the outside, but is still a little pink on the inside.

5) Wipe the wok clean with some paper towels. Be careful not to burn your 
hands on the hot wok surface!

6) Add 2 tablespoons of oil, and wait for the wok to heat up again.

7) Add the vegetables and stir constantly until they are soft, about 5 
minutes.

8) Add some water, amount depending on how much water has collected in the 
wok from the vegetables. Then cover the wok and let the vegetables steam 
for 3 minutes.

9) Add the browned meat and stir constantly until everything is hot, a 
couple of minutes. Serve immediately with brown rice.

<Name>Beef with Ginger and Onions</Name>
<Author>Marian Russell</Author>
<Ingredients>450 grams	beef (use a good cut like filet, which has no gristle or 
fat)
1 tsp.		salt
1/8 tsp.	pepper (or to taste)
1 1/2 Tbsp.	corn flour
1		egg white
2 large		onions, sliced into thin rings
1 Tbsp.		ginger, grated fine
    ---------------      
1 Tbsp.		sugar
3 Tbsp.		water
2 Tbsp.		soy sauce
    ---------------
2 tsp.		corn flour
2 Tbsp.		water
2 Tbsp.		sherry, medium dry
    ---------------
1/4 cup 	sesame oil
2 Tbsp.		vegetable shortening


</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1)  Cut the beef into thin strips (approx. 1 1/2 to 2 inches x 3/16-inch).  I find it easiest to first slice the beef into 3/16-inch layers, and then slice the layers into 3/16-inch wides strips, and then if the strips are too long, slice the strips in half (or thirds).  Put the beef strips into a bowl.

2)  Mix the salt and pepper together in a small bowl and then sprinkle this over the beef strips and mix well.  Add the first amount of corn flour (1 1/2 Tbsp.) and mix well.  Add the egg white and mix well.  Set the bowl by your stove in position 1.

3)  Put the sliced onions and grated ginger in a bowl together in position 2 by your stove.

4)  Mix the sugar, soy sauce and 3 Tbsp. of water together in a small bowl or cup and place in position 3 by your stove.

5)  Mix the 2 tsp. corn flour, the sherry and 2 Tbsp. of water in a small bowl or cup and place in position 4 by your stove.

6)  Heat the sesame oil in a large frying pan or wok over high heat.  When hot, stir-fry the beef for 1 1/2 minutes.  Take the pan from the heat while you remove the beef from the pan into a clean bowl.  Put this bowl between the soy sauce bowl and the sherry bowl.

7)  Return your pan to the heat and add the vegetable shortening.  When melted, stir fry the onions and ginger until the onions are tender.  (This is a tricky part, because you don&apos;t want to overcook the onions and yet you don&apos;t want to undercook them either.  I would say 5 minutes is about the maximum time, but be careful.  They should lose their hard round shape.  Taste them if you&apos;re not sure.  Cook them until they are no longer sharp.).

8)  Add the soy sauce mixture and mix well.

9)  Return the beef to the pan and mix well.

10)  Add the sherry mixture to the pan and mix well for about 1/2 a minute.

Serve with white rice.</Instructions>

<Ingredients>1 lb. chinese cabbage (Napa) 
2 stalks celery 
1/2 lb. cooked shrimp 
1/2 lb. cooked pork or chicken livers 
10 water chestnuts 
1/3 cup bamboo shoots

1 tsp. sugar 
Liberal dash pepper 
1/2 tsp. light soy sauce 
1/4 tsp. sesame oil 
1 beaten egg 
10 egg roll skins 
3 cups oil</Ingredients>
<Instructions>PREPARATION:
  Boil cabbage and celery until very tender.  Drain and squeeze
out excess water.  Shred very fine and set aside to 
drain further.  Parboil shrimp and fry or bake pork.  Mince both.  Shred
water chestnuts and bamboo shoots.  Mix all ingredients but egg together. 
Beat egg.  Wrap filling in egg roll skins and seal with egg. 
 
COOKING:  Heat oil in wok or deep fat fryer to 375 degrees and drop in egg
rolls.  When skin turns light golden brown, remove from oil and drain.  (At
this point restaurants refrigerate them and finish the cooking process as
needed.)  When cool, drop again into hot    oil and fry until golden brown.
 Makes 10. 
 
The two-stage deep frying method is actually a professional Chinese chefs&apos;
secret.  It assures that the inside will be moist and not overcooked (as
anything overcooked becomes dry) and the outside will be crisp.

have used it many times and have had a lot of success and our friends like

at least 30 minutes.                                                    
  Cut out squares of aluminum foil. Wrap each piece of chicken into a 
piece of foil dropping in a litte extra sauce mixture in with the 
chicken pieces Make sure chicken is securly wrapped with no leaks. Drop 
the foil parcels in hot fat and fry for about 2 minutes turning once if 
possible but not that important. Drain. The correct way to serve the 
chicken is in its wrapper, since the wrapping holds in the flavour and 
juices.

<Ingredients>Ingredients:
1/4 cup pork shredded pork
3 T corn starch
1 t sherry
2 large dried black mushrooms
1/4 cup dried wood ears
1/4 cup dried tiger lily stems
1/2 cup cold water
1/2 cup bamboo shoots, shredded
1-2 T oil
1 T soy sauce
6 cups Chicken Broth
2 T cider vinegar
2 T dark soy sauce      
1/2 cup bean curd, 1 inch cubes
1 egg, lightly beaten
8 drops Tabasco sauce (or as much as you wish for spicy soup to balance 
flavors
1 T sesame oil
2 t chopped scallions</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Directions:
1.  Mix the pork with sherry and 1 tsp corn starch(of the 3 TBS).
2.  Soak wood ears, mushrooms, tiger lillies with boiling water.  Cover and 
soak for 15 minutes.  Cut any of these up in a way that is desirable to you. 
 The mushrooms are the only vegetable that require cutting up.
3.  Mix the remaining cornstarch with 1/2 cup of cold water and set aside.
4.  Use a large pot which will eventually cook the soup and add oil.  Heat 
oil and add pork.  Cook several minutes until pink is gone.  Add the 
mushrooms, wood ears, tiger lillies, bamboo shoots, light soy sauce and cook 
for about 1 minute.  Add the chicken broth and dark soy sauce.  Cook until 
soup becomes well heated.  Add cider vinegar. Add bean curd
5.  As soon as the soup begins to boil stir in the well-stirred cornstarch 
mixture until the soup thickens.  Add the  Tabasco sauce.  Add Tofu.  
6.  Mix in the beaten egg, stirring constantly
7.  Taste the soup and adjust the vinegar, tabasco, soy sauce combination to 
your desire.
8.  Add the sesame oil and scallions.

NOTE:  THE KEY TO A GOOD TASTE IS THE BALANCE BETWEEN THE HOT(TABASCO), THE 
SOUR(VINEGAR), AND THE SOY SAUCE.  YOU MAY NEED TO EXPERIMENT TO FIT YOUR OWN 
TASTE.  I usually double or triple this recipe.  You can also use pepper 
instead of tabasco.

<Ingredients>Serves/Makes:One 3-qt casserole, 3&quot; deep

3 T butter (for casserole dish) 
Pudding: 
1 loaf white bread (fresh homemade is BEST!! and worth the effort) 
1 banana 
4 large eggs 
3-1/2 cups (825 ml) milk 
1/2 cup (125 ml) heavy, whipping-style cream 
1-1/3 cups (325 ml) sugar 
2 tbsp (30 ml) vanilla extract 
1/4 tsp (1 ml) cinnamon 
1/2 c walnuts, FINELY chopped 
Sauce: 
1 stick BUTTER 
1/2 cup (125 ml) sugar 
2 tbsp (30 ml) cognac 
1/4 cup (60 ml) water 
1/4 tsp (1 ml) freshly grated nutmeg 
1 egg 
3/4 cup (175 ml) heavy, whipping-style cream 
 </Ingredients>
<Instructions>Butter casserole with 3 tbsp (45 ml) butter. 
Cut bread into to 1/2&quot; cubes and place in buttered casserole. 
In blender, puree banana, eggs, milk, cream, sugar, vanilla extract and cinnamon. 
Pour liquid over bread cubes and let stand 1 HOUR, pressing down now and then with a spatula to make sure bread cubes are thoroughly wet. 
Just prior to baking sprinkle walnuts over top and press into pudding well with the spatula. 
Bake at 375 degrees (200 C.) until top is puffed and lightly golden--about 1 hour (Pudding will puff up--may have cracks--and will decrease in size as it cools; THIS IS EXPECTED). 
Drizzle Cognac Sauce (recipe below) over top and serve warm. 
Cognac Sauce: 
In large (2-qt capacity) bowl melt the butter. 
Whisk in sugar, cognac, water and nutmeg. 
Cook in microwave on medium high, stirring well after each minute, until the mixture is well blended and has come to a boil. 
Whisk an egg until frothy; then vigorously whisk into the cognac mixture. 
Return sauce to microwave and cook on high until thickened--stirring every 30 seconds. 
After sauce has cooled to room temperature, whisk in the heavy cream. 
Store left over sauce and pudding in the refrigerator--warm in microwave with the sauce on the pudding to serve after it&apos;s cold. 
Comments 
I took my grandmother&apos;s old, farm-style bread pudding recipe and jazzed it up. It goes over quite well--even people who tell me they don&apos;t like bread pudding end up asking for the recipe! (Unlike some dessert sauces that have liquor in them--this one is mild and only serves to compliment to delicate flavor of the bread pudding.)

<Name>Russian Easter Bread</Name>
<Author>Marie Coffel</Author>
<Ingredients>2 pkg. rapid rise yeast
3/4 cup lukewarm water
4 cups evaporated milk (do not dilute use straight from the can)
1 cup sugar
4 cups flour
*1 Tbsp. ground cardamom 
1 1/2 cups butter
3 cups sugar
2 Tbsp. salt
1 Tbsp. vanilla
1 Tbsp. grated orange peel
1 Tbsp. grated lemon peel
9 eggs
12 cups flour
3 cups raisins (white or dark)
1 cup chopped walnuts
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Dissolve yeast in the lukewarm water. Set aside. Scald and cool to lukewarm the 4 cups milk. Add yeast and the 1 cup sugar, 4 cups of the flour and the cardamom to the lukewarm milk. Mix into a smooth sponge and set in a warm place for approximately 2 hours. When sponge is done resting, melt and warm the butter. Stir the sugar, salt, vanilla and zest into the butter and add to the sponge. 
Gradually work in the flour until the dough is smooth and elastic. Knead for 5 minutes. Add nuts and raisins and knead another 5 minutes. Place in greased bowl and oil or butte dough to prevent crust from forming. Let rise until double in bulk. Roll into various sized balls and place in greased various sized metal cans you have saved. Oil the top of dough. Bake in a 350-degree oven. Baking time will vary depending on size of cans. 
When dough is done  remove from pan and butter the crust. Place on baking rack to cool. 

You may substitute almond or lemon extract for cardamom. </Instructions>

<Notes>Easter Bread is consumed on Easter Sunday to break the Lenten Fast and used for forty days after Easter. Marie is one of Chuda&apos;s Children from Kenai. This recipe is not the traditional one because of the addition of peels and cardamom, which was not available in the villages. The rest is similar. This is a wonderful Easter Bread.
The brightest and most colorful eggs are made by using vinegar, boiling water and Wilton&apos;s food coloring paste. I recommend wearing rubber gloves because this dye tends to stain your hands.

<Name>ROAST LEG OF LAMB WITH ARTICHOKES</Name>
<Author>Unknown (InterNet)</Author>
<Ingredients>5.5 pound leg of lamb
3 large cloves garlic, cut in thin slivers
0.25 cup olive oil
0.25 cup plus 2 tablespoons lemon juice, divided
2 teaspoons oregano
0.5 teaspoon rosemary, crumbled
0.5 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
8 small or 4 medium-sized artichokes</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Preheat oven to 500 degrees F. Trim excess fat from lamb. 
With sharp paring knife, cut small slits in lamb; insert
garlic slivers. Place lamb, rounded side up, in large shallow
roasting pan; set aside. 

In small bowl, combine olive oil, 0.25 cup lemon juice,
oregano, 1 tsp. salt, rosemary and pepper; brush over lamb. 
If using meat thermometer, insert into thickest part of lamb
without touching bone. Place lamb in oven. IMMEDIATELY
reduce temperature to 350 deg. F. 

Roast 1.5 - 2 hours or until thermometer registers 140 degrees
for rare, 160 for medium, or 170 for well done. Baste lamb
with pan juices every 20 minutes. 

Wash artichokes under cold running water; cut off tops 0.5 to
1 inch; trim stems, leaving about 0.5 inch stub; remove small
tough outer leaves at base; snip off prickly leaf tips with
scissors. Leave small artichokes whole. Spread petals
slightly with fingers. Scoop out fuzzy choke at stem end with
small spoon. Cut medium sized artichokes in half lengthwise;
scoop out choke. 

Drop artichokes into large saucepan filled with cold water,
the remaining 2 tablespoons lemon juice and 1 tsp. salt, if
desired. Bring water just to a simmer; cover. Cook small
artichokes 20-25 minutes; medium sized ones for 25-30 minutes
or just until firm tender. To test, insert tines of fork into
stem end - it should be firm but &quot;give&quot; slightly; drain. 

About 30 minutes before lamb is done, arrange artichokes in
roasting pan around lamb. Pour 0.5 cup hot water into
roasting pan. Baste artichoke with pan juices a few times
during final roasting. 

Remove lamb to large serving platter; remove meat thermometer. 
Arrange artichokes around lamb. Cover loosely with foil; let
stand 15 minutes before carving. 

Pour off all drippings from roasting pan into large measuring
cup; let stand so that fat separates from juices at bottom;
remove fat and discard. Pour pan juices back into roasting
pan; add 0.5 cup hot water. Place roasting pan over low heat
and heat to serving temperature, stirring constantly. Pour
into gravy boat.

This sauce is great and has a good tangy flavor to it. I usually double this recipe and store it in a plastic container (peanut butter jars work great). Keeps for a long time. Great on chicken and babyback ribs!

<Name>Noni afghani (afghan bread)</Name>
<Author>Copeland Mark</Author>
<Ingredients>1 1/2 c Water, warm 
1 pk (1/4 oz, 7 grams) dry yeast 
1 tb Sugar 
4 c Flour 
1 ts Salt 
1/4 c Corn oil 
1  Egg yolk, mixed w/ 
1 tb Water 
1 tb Black cuminseed or caraway 
  -seeds 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>These small oval breads are baked in a tandoor, the stove of the region -- sometimes buried in the ground as it is in India. The Afghan oven is above ground &amp; is of rounded bricks, which are heated. Matzoh &amp; noni are shaped &amp; slapped &amp; stuck on the hot bricks for fast baking.
1. Mix 1/2 cup of warm water, yeast, &amp; sugar together &amp; let it proof for 10 mins. When froth appears, sprinkle 1/2 ts flour on top &amp; let it continue to proof for 5 mins more. The froth will rise quickly.

2. Put flour in a large mixing bowl &amp; sprinkle salt over it. Make a well in middle of flour &amp; add oil &amp; yeast mixture. Stir this in &amp; add small amounts of water until you have produced a soft, moist dough that can be handled. Knead well for 5 mins. Put dough ball back in bowl, cover w/towel, &amp; let rise for 1-1/2 hours. Punch down dough.

3. Divide dough into 8 equal parts &amp; roll each part into a ball. Roll each ball into a oval shape 6 to 7 inches long &amp; 1/2 inch thick. Draw tines of a fork in 3 lines along length of each noni for a decorative design. Paint each noni w/egg mixture &amp; sprinkle over all 1/2 ts black cuminseeds. (This is traditional seed to use, but caraway seeds may be substituted if black cuminseed is unobtainable. Put noni on an ungreased cookie sheet &amp; bake in a preheated 350 F. oven for 20 to 25 mins. The brown top will glisten. Makes 8 noni.

2 lg Cloves garlic 
1/2 ts Salt 
2 c Plain, whole-milk yogurt 
Juice and pulp of 1 large lemon, 3  to 4 tablespoons 
1/2 ts Cracked black pepper 
2 lg Whole chicken breasts, about  2 pounds 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Long, slow marinating in garlicky yogurt tenderizes, moistens and adds deep flavor, so you end up with skinless grilled chicken that&apos;s as delicious as it is nutritionally correct. Serve with soft pita or Arab flatbread and fresh yogurt.
Put the salt in a wide, shallow non-reactive bowl with the garlic and mash them together until you have paste. Add yogurt, lemon and pepper.

Skin the chicken breasts, remove all visible fat and separate the halves. Bend each backward to break the bones so the pieces win lie flat. Add to the yogurt and turn so all surfaces are well-coated.

Cover the bowl tightly and refrigerate. Allow to marinate at least overnight, up to a day and a half. Turn when you think of it.

To cook, remove breasts from marinade and wipe off all but a thin film. Broil or grill about 6 inches from the heat for 6 to 8 minutes a side, or until thoroughly cooked. Meat will brown somewhat but should not char. Serve at once.

Serve the polo w/salads, pickles, &amp; Afghan bread

VARIATION: The polo can be prepared w/chicken &amp; boneless beef chuck or ribs of beef. Stir-fry 15 pieces of chicken (legs, thighs, &amp; breast) or 4 lbs beef, w/onions as in the basic recipes; all other steps are the same. The beef will take longer to tenderize &amp; it is suggested that it be cooked w/onions in a covered pan for 20 mins before moving on to the next steps.

  Hungarian paprika 

5,6 lb brisket; 1st cut

 *Sliced paper thin (3 is not a typo)</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Remove any excess fat from brisket, but leave a little on top. Place one half of the onions on bottom of pan. Season the onions with a little salt, pepper, garlic powder and lots of Hungarian paprika. Place brisket on top of onions, then other half of onions and allspice on top of the brisket. Cover and roast in a 300 degree F. oven for 3 hours. Test your brisket and when it is fork tender, take it out. Let it cool and then slice it very thin. Strain juice and either thicken it with a little cornstarch or serve it au jus. You will have a very dark brown juice. NOTE: Best when made one day in advance. Aunt Sadie almost always served this with savory noodle kugel. I also serve it with roasted, boiled or mashed potatoes. Use a good roasting pan with a lit that fits well or covered with heavy duty aluminum foil. Spray pan and inside of lid with Pam.</Instructions>

1/2 ts Ground cinnamon 
1 c Strawberry or grape or 
  -prune jam (lekach) 
2 tb Bread crumbs 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Bichak are popular appetizers for tea or coffee hour. The pumpkin &amp; jam stuffings are on the sweet side while meat &amp; cheese are savory &amp; could be eaten for lunches w/salad &amp; dish of yoghurt. An added attraction is that they may be prepared in large quantities, cooled &amp; frozen for the future.
Heat oil in a pan, add onions, &amp; saute over moderate heat until onions turn golden. Add water, salt, sugar, &amp; squash or calabasa or pumpkin &amp; bring to a boil. Cover pan &amp; cook over low heat for abt 20 mins as squash/calabasa/pumpkin becomes soft &amp; disintegrates. Stir now &amp; then, which in effect mashes contents. Continue last mins of cooking, uncovered, to evaporate all liquid &amp; create &amp; thick jam. The mash is still moist.

MEAT: Heat oil in a skillet &amp; brown onions lightly over moderate heat. Add meat, salt, &amp; pepper &amp; stir-fry for 5 mins, making certain liquid has evaporated &amp; mixture is dry. Cool.

CHEESE: Mix everything together. Set aside.

JAM: Mix jam &amp; crumbs together. Set aside.

TO PREPARE TRICORNERS: 1. Mix 1/2 c warm water, sugar, &amp; yeast together &amp; proof in a warm place until mixture foams, abt 10 mins.

2. Make a well in flour, add yeast mixture, oil, &amp; 1 egg white, &amp; stir them into flour. Add balance of water, or enough water to prepare a soft dough. Knead for several mins &amp; roll into a ball. Oil top lightly &amp; leave dough in mixing bowl. Cover bowl w/foil or a towel &amp; let rise for 45 mins to 1 hour.

3. Punch down dough ball. Pull off abt 1/2 cup of dough &amp; roll into a slightly flattened ball. Prepare 6 balls.

4. On well-floured board roll out each ball, 1 at a time, to 12-&quot; pancake. Using empty can or a cookie cutter, 3-&quot; in diameter, cut out circles in pancake. Put 1 tb of whichever stuffing you are using, or variety of stuffings, in center of each circle. Fold over right &amp; left side of circle to meet in the center &amp; bring up bottom to cover stuffing. Pinch ends together to form tricorner pastry. Seal in contents. Paint tops of bichak w/egg yolk.

5. Line baking pan or cookie sheet w/lightly oiled aluminum foil. Place tricorners on foil &amp; bake in a preheated 350F. oven for abt 40 mins, or until brown. Serve warm. Makes 48 to 50 bichak.

<Ingredients>Ingredients: 

1 lb Chicken livers 
3/4 c Chicken fat (available from 
  -your butcher) 
1 c Coarsely chopped onions 
4  Hard-cooked eggs, peeled 
1 ts Salt 
1 ds Pepper 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Wash chicken livers and pat dry with towel. Set aside.
Cut up chicken fat and put in a skillet with onions. Saute, stirring occasionally, to prevent burning the onions. Cook until the onions are lightly browned and fat is melted. Remove onions and set aside. Pour liquid chicken fat into a cup and set aside.

Place livers in the same skillet with 3 tablespoons of the liquid chicken fat and saute until well done. Add additional chicken fat, if necessary. Cool slightly.

Using a food grinder with a fine blade, a food blender at high speed, a food processor with a metal blade, or a chopping bowl, finely grind or chop livers, hard-cooked eggs, and onions. Place mixture in a bowl, add salt, pepper and about 1/4 cup liquid fat. If additional fat is necessary, add salad oil, one tablespoon at a time, to the mixture. Mix until all ingredients are well blended.

Fill a well-oiled 3-cup mold or shape into a simple ball and refrigerate. Serve with cocktail-size rye bread slices.

<Name>Corned tongue</Name>
<Author>Unknown (InterNet)</Author>
<Ingredients>Ingredients: 

1  Tongue, beef 
  Water, as needed 
1  Salt, kosher; as needed 
1  Egg, in shell 
1/2 c Sugar, brown, dark 
2  Bay leaf; crumbled 
1/2 ts Allspice, whole; bruised 
1/2 ts Peppercorns; bruised 
2 ts Coriander seeds; bruised 
1 ts Mustard seeds; bruised 
2  Garlic clove; peeled 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Select a ceramic, glass or enameled crock or bowl large enough to hold both the tongue and enough brine to cover the tongue by two or more inches. Be sure the container will fit in the refrigerator. To determine the brine quantity needed, enclose the tongue in a plastic bag and run cold water into the container to cover the bagged meat by two to three inches. Remove the tongue. Stir kosher salt gradually into the water, dissolving thoroughly each time, until an egg will float in it. (This will run about a cup and a half of salt.) Remove the egg once it&apos;s served its purpose and pour the brine into a pot. Stir all the other ingredients into the brine and bring to a boil, then simmer, covered, for 15 minutes. Let brine cool completely. Remove the tongue from the plastic bag and prick it well all over with a skewer or larding needle. Return to the crock. Once the brine has cooled, pour it over the tongue. Cover with Saran, then add a plate (weighted, if need be) to keep the meat well under the surface. Cover the whole crock with Saran and refrigerate for 10 days to 2 1/2 weeks (allow three days a pound curing time). Turn the meat every few days, and be sure to keep it always sunk in the brine. To cook: Put the tongue in a pot with water to cover by several inches, two or three carrots coarsely chopped, a whole onion or two (peeled), a few tablespoons of vinegar, and simmer, partly covered, until the meat is very tender. Remove from the stock, and slit the skin and peel it away. Serve hot or cold.

<Name>Roast Duck with Orange Sauce</Name>
<Author>Mama Leah&apos;s Jewish Kitchen</Author>
<Ingredients>Ingredients: 

3 1/2 lb To 4-1/2 lb duck 
1  Orange, peeled 
  Salt 
  Garlic powder 
1/2 c Brown sugar 
1 tb Cornstarch 
1 c Orange juice 
1 tb Orange rind, grated 
1  Lemon&apos;s juice 
2 tb Orange liqueur (optional) 
2  Oranges, sliced into rounds 
  Parsley, for garnish 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
Wash the duck, dry it, and make sure to remove any remaining pinfeathers. Pull away and discard any loose pieces of fat. Place the peeled orange inside the cavity. Sprinkle the outside of the duck lightly with salt and garlic powder. Rub the salt and garlic into the skin but do not prick the skin.

Line the bottom of roasting pan with aluminum foil to catch to grease as it melts. Place the duck on a rack in the roasting pan.

Cook in the preheated oven for 1 hour.

In the meantime, in a bowl, mix together the brown sugar and cornstarch. In a saucepan, place the mixture together with the orange juice, orange rind, lemon juice, and the orange liqueur, if desired. Stir well and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, stirring constantly until the mixture loses its cloudiness and thickens slightly.

Remove the duck from the oven and allow it to cool for 10 to 15 minutes. (Do not turn off the oven.) Split the duck in half using poultry shears or a sharp knife. Remove the breastbone. Once you split the duck, you will find it easy to gently pry the breastbone away from the meat. Drain off any accumulated fat from the roasting pan. Place the duck halves on the rack, skin side up. Brush the duck with the orange sauce and reserve the remaining sauce to serve at the table.

Roast the duck for another 30 to 40 minutes. When done, the skin should be very crisp and browned. Serve the duck surrounded by the orange rounds and garnished with parsley. Pour the warm orange sauce into a gravy bowl and pass around. This duck goes very nicely with any rice dish. Makes 2 to 3 servings.

</Instructions>
<Serves>0</Serves>
<Notes>ADVICE FROM MAMA: For a very fancy variation, in a small saucepan, heat 1/3 cup of orange liqueur. Place the roasted duck halves on a preheated serving platter, decorate, and pour the heated liqueur over the duck. Strike a match and light the liqueur in the bottom of the platter. Carry the duck flambe to the dinning table to a chorus of ooohs and aaahs. For an exotic variation, try mixing together 1/3 cup of honey, 1/3 cup of orange juice, and 1 teaspoon of curry powder. Season the duck to taste as usual. Apply half of the sweet, spicy mixture to the bird. Roast in the preheated oven as above. Periodically baste the duck with remaining mixture. This delicious coating on the duck will have you dreaming of warm nights in Kashmir.

2 md Onions, peeled 
2 lg Eggs, well beaten 
3 lg Tablespoons flour, cracker

  -matzo meal 
2 ts Baking powder 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Pare potatoes; let soak in bowl of ice water for 2 or 3 hours, drain.
2. Using fine grating disk of food processor, or the finest side of a four sided grater, grate potatoes into a medium bowl, grating the onions with the potatoes as you work. (The juice prevents the potatoes from darkening.)

3. Drain mixture through a large sieve set over a large bowl. Squeeze handfuls of the potato/onion mixture over sieve, allowing liquid to drain into the bowl. Let the liquid from the potatoes stand a few minutes to allow starch sediment to collect in the bottom of the bowl.

4. Meanwhile, mix the potato/onion mixture with the eggs, flour, baking powder, 1 teaspoon salt and dash of pepper. Add 1 tablespoon more flour, if needed to thicken mixture to consistancy of cooked cereal. Carefully pour or spoon off liquid from potatoes; add sediment only to the potato-egg mixture, stirring till just blended.

5. Preheat oven to 250 degrees F. In a 12&quot; skillet, over medium high heat, heat 1/2&quot; salad oil until hot but not smoking. Place heaping tablespoons of the potato mixture in the hot oil; with back of fork, flatten slightly. Fry about 5 pancakes at a time until golden, turning once, 3 minutes in all. Remove pancakes with slotted spoon; drain on paper towel lined baking sheet. Place in oven to keep warm while frying remaining pancakes. If desired serve pancakes with applesauce or sour cream.

<Name>Kangaroo and Mushrooms with Red Wine</Name>
<Author>Peter Bradley</Author>
<Ingredients>600 gms loin (or long) fillet of kangaroo 
6 to 10 mushrooms preferably field mushrooms 
A good knob of butter, say 40 gms 
Half a glass of good Australian red wine (the Barossa Valley Estate 1995 Shiraz Cabernet was wonderful!) 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Melt the butter in a large iron frying pan or on a barbecue plate. Brown kangaroo steak and add sliced mushrooms. When the steak is browned on both sides quickly slice into pieces about 1.5 to 2 cm thick. Quickly brown the slices on both sides and cook until the steak is nearly cooked - not too well done please! It should be still a little pink inside. Throw in the red wine and allow to continue cooking for a few more moments. Remove the meat and mushrooms and place on plates.

If you are using a pan you can reduce the remaining fluid a little then pour it over the meat.

Serve with potatoes cooked in their jackets or cut into slices and fried and salad or green vegetable depending on the season.

Of course the remainder of the red wine will not go to waste.
</Instructions>
<Serves>2</Serves>
<Notes>For those connoisseurs of kangaroo the Northern Territory Blue Flier is the best kangaroo meat you can get. Kangaroo is a very rich meat which is low on cholesterol, most people would not eat as much kangaroo as they would beef steak.

And for the wine lover the Barossa Valley Estate 1995 Shiraz Cabernet is a medium bodied red wine full of ripe berry flavours and low on tannin. My wife, who is not normally fond of red wines, loves it. I can recommend it as an excellent accompaniment to kangaroo.</Notes>

<Instructions>Sift flour and salt, mix water and lemon juice. Soften shortening slightly with a knife and divide into 4 equal portions. Rub one portion of shortening into flour. Mix into a dough with the water and lemon juice. Turn onto a floured board and knead lightly until pastry is smooth and pliable. Roll pastry into rectangular shape.

Flake one portion of shortneing on top two thirds of rectangle. Fold in three by placing the lower third over center third, and top over lower third. Rest pastry in refrigerator for 5 minutes.

Turn pastry so that the folded edge is to the left. Press rolling pin at intervals along pastry, thus evening the shortening. Roll out again, rolling away from you to keep the layers of flakes even in the pastry. Use short light strokes and keep the pastry in good rectangular shpae. Rest pastry in the refrigerator between each rolling and folding.

Proceed as before until the remaining portions of shortening have been used. Cover and place pastry in refrigerator until needed.

3 chicken breast
3 pairs of chicken gizzards
2 onions 1 big (grated/cut into tiny pieces) and 
   one small (sliced and shredded)
3 table spoons turmeric paste/puree
5 table spoons sugar
5 cups water
6 heaped tea spoons of ghee
2 tea spoons salt</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Soak wheat and leave wheat in water for 3 hours. Boil wheat, chicken breast and big (grated) onion in 3 cups of water. Add 1 tea spoon of salt and keep cooking on low fire.
On another side of the cooker make sweet turmeric sauce. Cut chicken gizzards into small pieces and boil with 3 spoons of turmeric paste/puree in 1/2 cup of water, add a pinch of salt and 3 table spoons of sugar. Leave the sauce to cool.
Once wheat is thoroughly cooked, take out the chicken breast, they should also be well cooked by now to the point that they almost start to shred when you just touch them. Cut chicken breast into small pieces and shred well. Put the chicken back into the bowl of wheat and start to stir. By now the wheat you are cooking should have started turning into a thick paste. Add 2 to 3 spoons of ghee and keep stirring until the shredded chicken is evenly distributed. The heaviness or thickness of wheat paste should almost feel like dough when kneaded and ready for baking. If the paste is too hard add a little water. Once ready, take off from fire and cover the wheat paste.
On one side of cooker, take a small frying pen and fry the small (shredded) onion in 3 to 4 spoons of ghee. Keep stirring until onions turn red and crispy.

The turmeric sauce with pieces of chicken gizzards is served in one small bowl.
Deep fried onions with all the ghee are also poured into another bowl and put on the table (allow a few minutes to cool but not solidify)
Boko boko is served while still warm (not hot, you could end up badly burnt). One may choose to either eat it with the fried onions (where by one also adds the ghee that is with the onions) or one may choose to eat boko boko with the turmeric sauce.

<Notes>In Tanzania, as in other African countries, soups and sauces are served in a consistency that is as thick as our stews. Coconut Bean Soup would be used there as a meatless main dish by increasing the quantities of beans and rice. However, in adapting this recipe in our test kitchen we thinned it to soup consistency with additional water and served it as a delightful soup course. Any dried beans such as black-eyed peas or pea beans can be used in this soup. Just cover with 
water and cook until tender before combining them with the other ingredients. Coconut milk and the delicate use of curry give the soup its unusual flavor. </Notes>

<Author>Unknown (Internet)</Author>
<Ingredients>1 quart water
1 tea spoon salt
1 cup white cereal (e.g. farina)

</Ingredients>
<Instructions>In a 2-quart saucepan: 
Boil rapidly 1 quart WATER or CHICKEN BROTH. 
Add: 1 tsp. SALT and 
1 cup ANY FINE WHITE CEREAL. 
Swirl the cereal into the boiling water and cook according to package directions 
to a thick heavy mush. 
Keep warm over hot water (in a double boiler) until ready to serve. 

Serving:
Put in a big glass or plastic bowl then cover with a big plate. Turn upside down so that &apos;ugali&apos; whic is now bowl shaped gets in the plate. Take a smaller dish and press on the top of &apos;ugali&apos; to form a hole. Pour coconut cream red kidney beans or tapioca leaves, or duckling into the hole and serve. Usually every one eats together. In case some one wants to eat separately, serve a portion of &apos;ugali&apos; in their plate and pour any of the above mentioned soups onto it.

<Notes>One of the foods most frequently used in both East and West Africa is a mush or gruel made by pounding fresh corn and squeezing out the cornstarch. When it is cooked in boiling water to a gruel consistency and used as a breakfast cereal it is called Uji (Ogi, in West Africa). When it is cooked to a thicker consistency, so that it can easily be rolled into a ball, it is called Ugali (Agidi in West Africa). As a substitute you can use cornmeal grits or buckwheat grits. Africans in our country use any fine white cereal such as Farina or Cream of Wheat. These cereals are surprisingly tasty when served with meat and poultry gravies. Stone- ground white cornmeal can be purchased in specialty food shops. For added flavor, try cooking cornmeal grits, farina, or any cereal in chicken or beef stock instead of water. The cereals absorb the flavor of the stock and make an excellent accompaniment for meats. Rice and couscous, that wonderful semolina grain used so abundantly in North Africa, are delicious when prepared in this way. In Swahili any thick mush is called Ugali. There is a light Ugali made with cornmeal flour and there is a dark Ugali made with millet flour, and often groundnuts (peanuts) are ground in with the mush. </Notes>

<Name>Biriyani Rice</Name>
<Author>Unknown (Internet)</Author>
<Ingredients>2 Kilo grams RED Onions
2 Kilo grams Chicken (thighs &amp; drumsticks)
4 cups Basmati rice (long grain rice)
2 tb spn canned tomato
2 large regular tomatoes
1 bunch mint leaves
1 bunch parsley
5 spices (cinnamon bark - 3 medium pieces, cardamom - 6 pieces, cumin seeds, black pepper - about 1/6 tea spoon, cloves - 3 to 4 sticks)
4 medium sized potatoes
2 cups yogurt
6-8 lemons
Salt to taste
5-6 sections/pieces from 1 head garlic medium sized
1 node fresh ginger, about 1 inch long and 1/2 inch diameter (not powdered)

</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Wash the rice 2 or 3 times until the whitishness does not re appear in the water.
Boil the rice until it is half done, sieve and throw away the starchy fluid
Mix the rice with a big pinch of strands of saffron, about 20 or 30 strands.
In a big cooking pot, fry the garlic in GHEE
Raise the temperature of ghee and put in the chicken.. fry at high temperature only to brown the chicken... remove quickly so that the juices from the chicken do not get out (you will need them for later). Remove the chicken and put on a paper towel to drain the oil and remove the pot from the fire
Now put everything BUT THE RICE, into another pot and mix them nicely (all the spices -ground-, the chicken, yogurt, ginger, garlic etc). Add salt and make sure that you can taste the salt (don&apos;t go over board) also make sure that the mix taste for sourness.
Pour rice on top of all the mixed stuff.
Boil some ghee on another pot or pan and pour on top of the rice. Cover the pot with tinfoil and make sure you do this well, make it snuggle nicely. Then use your regular pot cover over this.
Cook in medium low (second option between low and medium) for about 30 minutes. {Alternatively you could cook it in the oven at about 250 that is about 30-40% lower temp than you would use for backing cake - if cooking in the oven, you will need to time it for 45 minutes, after 45 minutes you will need to poke in a fork all the way to the bottom to feel if its done or not}
To be done, the rice on the top will be cooked and the bottom of the pot will stay a little bit soggy. 
Time to serve, NOW you will need a big deep bowl like plate, uncover the pot completely, clear the area for a little work. Cover the pot with the plate, serving side facing the pot. Lift the pot in such a way that with a quick twist, you can flip it over where the plate is at the bottom and the pot is on top of it. If you used a plate big enough, nothing will fall on the floor when you pull up the pot. So now pull up the pot. The thick curry should be at the top and may slightly run if it was not cooked at right temperature, but that is not a bad thing. The biriyani curry is one of the best curry you will ever taste. Remember what I said about NOT over frying the chicken, not losing the juices?? Well what has happened is that the juices from the chicken combined with tomatoes, yogurt and other stuff and made the rich biriyani curry at the low cooking temperatures.

Serving
Usually in Africa and the Middle East, the whole BIG plate is set in the middle and every one eats hand in hand from it, sitting on the floor around it. However, though that is the best way for socializing and breaking class barrier, you can serve it any way you like in your home. You could set the big plate in the middle of the table and every one can serve into their plates (especially if you do not have eaters hehehe), and take the amount they need.

Every one taking a serving should take the curry and all, that is the best part, if biriyani is cooked right, I would swear it is the best food in the world as far as taste is concerned. However, this here is chicken biriyani, the more authentic one is beef/veal biriyani, I will get the recipe for that when mom has time and I will post it here for you. She says there is a little difference in preparation. I know there is a lot of difference in taste!

<Author>Unknown (Internet)</Author>
<Ingredients>1 cup of flour (white)
1 tablespoon ghee (cow shortening)
1/2 tea sp or less salt</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Melt ghee in a small frying pan DO NOT boil it.
Mix ghee with flour and salt.
Then mix with warm water (add just a little bit of water at a time and mix the dough thoroughly, make sure the dough is not hard) keep for at least one hour. Then separate dough into small rolls similar to oven cupcake buns. Use rolling pin and roll the dough balls each on a large flat surface (Formica counter top does great) as you roll the pin spread a little ghee on the dough and then tear the now flat pizza like dough spread from the center by pulling evenly to all edges and cut one side so you are left with a long lean piece of dough in your hands. Roll it into a coil (snakes) from each end in opposite directions (one clock wise and the other end counter clock wise) when they get together, then twist one of the collected coil and put it over the other. 
Clean area over the oven top and keep a wide flat heavy/thick frying pan on the cooking range, turn on the cooker at low. Leave the dough for about 10 minutes then roll with rolling pin on flat surface into an evenly spread round (pizza like) thin spread. Turn the heat on to medium using oiling brush, spread a little ghee evenly all around the pan and cook the chappatis. Keep turning (rotating it) to ensure even cooking and turn over and keep pressing after turning and also put ghee on top but not too much and keep on pressing in the frying pen until light brown.

<Notes>Ethhiopian Flat Bread, or injera, is traditionally made with a grain called teff, common to Ethiopia. Instead of baking soda or powder, Ethiopian cooks use a fermentation process for leavening. Made in flat rounds resembling large buckwheat pancakes, this spongy, moist bread is often 15 inches across. Injera is used to pick up bits of meat and vegetables at Ethiopian meals -- no silverware is used.</Notes>

<Instructions>Sift dry ingredients. Lightly stir in milk. Add more flour as necessary to make a dough you can handle. Kneed and work the dough on a floured board with floured hands until smooth. Pinch off fist-sized limps and shap into a disk -- everyone has their own characteristic shapes.(Shape affects the taste, by the way because of how it fries). For Indian tacos, the disk must be rather flat, with a depression -- almost a hole -- in the center of both sides. Make it that way if the fry bread is going to have some sauce over it. Smaller, round ones are made to put on a plate. Fry in fat (about 375°) until golden and done on both sides, about 5 minutes. Drain on absorbent paper. (Phyllis Jarvis, Paiute)

</Ingredients>
<Instructions>In a large saucepan, stir together the water, lemon juice and powdered pectin.  Scrape the sides of the pan to make sure all the pectin has dissolved.
  
Place the saucepan over high heat and bring to a boil.  Stir constantly to prevent scorching.  Add the sugar and herbs while stirring. Bring the mixture to a full,  rolling boil 4 minutes, then remove from the heat.  Skim the foam off the top of the mixture and pour into clean, sterilized jars.

*** NOTE *** If the herb jelly does not set overnight, remove the parrafin and reheat the mixture over high heat. Bring to a hard rolling boil 2 minutes, repour into the jars, and reseal. Because you are working with herbs and not fruit, sometimes the pectin doesn&apos;t  react the first time and needs to be reboiled.

  fish.  Fish soup, or u&apos;nega&apos;gei, as the Iroquois
  called it, was a favorite.  One early recipe is
  described, &quot;Fish of any kind is boiled in a pot with a
  quantity of water. It is then removed and coarse corn
  siftings stirred in to make a soup of suitable
  consistency.&quot;  When wild onions and greens were
  available, they were usually tossed into the soup pot,

<Ingredients>8 medium potatos, peeled
small bunch of scallions (spring onions)
1/4 pt/125ml/1/2 cup milk
salt and pepper
knob of butter per person
(serves four)


</Ingredients>
<Instructions>The best way to prepare the potatoes is to cook them in a steamer and then pass them through a food mill. Alternatively, boil until soft but not mushy, drain and return them to the heat to dry somewhat before mashing. In any case keep hot. Chop the scallions finely, both green and white parts, and cook for 5 minutes in the milk. Beat this mixture into the mashed potatoes until smoooth and fluffy, season to taste and serve a large mound on each plate with a good knob of butter melting into the top. Each forkful is dipped into the melted butter as it is eaten. Very good with a glass of cold milk.
Colcannon is made in much the same way as champ, but with the addition of cabbage. In parts of the country white cabbage is always used. In any case, shred and chop a small cabbage (discard the stump) and cook until tender. Beat into the potato mixture and serve as above.

<Author>A Little Irish Cookbook</Author>
<Ingredients>3-5 lb/ 1 1/2-2 kg ham
cider to cover
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 tsp mustard
20 whole cloves

</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Cover the ham with cold water and bring slowly to the boil. Throw out the water and replace with cider. Bring this just to the boil and lower the heat, keeping the liquid barely simmering for 20 minutes to the 1 lb/ 1/2 kg. Remove from the heat and allow to stand in the liquid for 30 minutes. Take out the ham, skin it and score the fat with a sharp knife in a diamond pattern. Stud with whole cloves. Mix the sugar and mustard and rub well into the surface of the ham. Bake in a pre-heated oven for a further 10 minutes to the 1 lb / 1/2 kg at gas mark 6, 400°F, 200°C.

<Notes>To the Irish, ham is a cured leg of pork. The preserving process is carried out in a number of different ways: salting, smoking, immersion in brine or even honey. Traditionally, Limerick ham is smoked over juniper branches. Whole hams should be steeped in cold water overnight before cooking but this is not necessary with smaller joints. The ham in this recipe is not really baked but rather finished off in the oven after having been cooked by simmering in cider.

<Ingredients>1 live lobster, about 2 lb
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup Irish whiskey
1/2 cup whipping cream
salt and pepper
(serves two)</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Toss the lobster meat in foaming butter over a medium heat for a few minutes until cooked. Take care that the butter does not burn. Add the whiskey and when it has heated up set light to it. Pour in the cream, heat through and season. 
Serve in the half shells with plainly boiled fine beans. 

This dish is delicious and traditional - a happy combination - though its expensive ingredients make it a rare treat rather than an everyday affair. For the best flavor the fish has to be freshly killed just before cooking.  Plunge a sharp knife into the cross on the back of the head. Slice in half lengthwise and crack open the claws. Remove all the flesh and cut into large chunks. Keep both halves of the shell for serving</Instructions>

<Ingredients>8 oz/ 250g/ 2 cups plain flour
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp sugar
1 large egg
1/2 pt/ 250ml/ 1 cup buttermilk</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Sift the dry ingredients into a bowl. Make a well in the middle with a wooden spoon and add the egg. Break the yolk and pour in the buttermilk, mixing quickly to a thick batter. Do not beat, as this would develop the gluten in the flour and prevent the pancakes from rising. Fry in large dollops on a lightly-greased, hot griddle or heavy frying-pan. Drop scones are best served hot for tea, thickly spread with melting butter and syrup or jam. 

These are also known as Scotch Pancakes, especially in the north. They must be cooked as soon as possible after mixing, as the acid in the buttermilk starts to react with the baking soda at once. For that reason the griddle or pan should be heated before combining the ingredients.</Instructions>

<Ingredients>1lb/ 1/2kg/ 4 cups plain flour
1 tsp salt
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp sugar (optional)
1pt/ 1/2 lr/ 2 cups buttermilk or sour milk
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Sieve the dry ingredients into a large bowl. Scoop up handfuls and allow to drop back into the bowl to aerate the mixture. Add enough buttermilk to make a soft dough. Now work quickly as the buttermilk and soda are already reacting. Knead the dough lightly - too much handling will toughen it, while too little means it won&apos;t rise properly.
Form a round loaf about as thick as your fist. Place it on a lightly-floured baking sheet and cut a cross in the top with a floured knife. Put at once to bake near the top of a pre-heated oven, gas mark 8, 450°F, 230°C, for 30-45 minutes. When baked, the loaf will sound hollow when rapped on the bottom with your knuckles. Wrap immediately in a clean tea-towel to stop the crust hardening too much.

<Notes>Wheaten bread or brown soda is made in exactly the same way but with wholemeal flour replacing all or some of the white flour; this mixture will probably require less buttermilk. Another variation is to add 1/2 cup of sultanas to the white bread - this loaf is known as Spotted Dick.

This bread is popular throughout Ireland. Because it is easily and quickly made it is often baked fresh for tea or even breakfast. At home we used to call the loaf made with white flour soda bread, while that made with wholemeal was wheaten bread. In other parts of the country wheaten bread is referred to as brown soda or, confusingly, soda bread! </Notes>

sprig of parsley
2 cups water
salt and pepper
(serves four)

<Instructions>Cut the meat into good size chunks. Peel the vegetables and slice thickly. Chop the parsley. Choose a pot with a well-fitting lid and put in the ingredients in layers, starting and finishing with potatoes. Pour in the water and season to taste. Cover and put on a very low heat for about 2 1/2 hours until the meat is tender and the potatoes have thickened the liquid. The dish may also be made with lamb, in which case it requires only 1 1/2 hours cooking time. </Instructions>
<Serves>0</Serves>
<Notes>Irish stew is easy to make and if made with mutton and cooked slowly will be both flavorsome and tender. Mutton, being an older meat, has more flavor than lamb but does need to be cooked for a couple of hours over a low heat with liquid. It should not be allowed to boil or the flavor will be spoiled. There is little agreement as to the classic recipe - should there be carrots? Should the meat be browned? Should mutton, lamb, beef, bacon or even kid be used? The following dish will be found to be hearty and nourishing and traditional enough.</Notes>

<Name>The Recipe for Kapsa (Chicken &amp; Rice)</Name>
<Author>Unknown (Internet)</Author>
<Ingredients>1 1/2 cups White Basmati Rice-cleaned &amp; rinsed (Do not use other kinds of rice for this recipe) 
Water (amount varies according to the size of boiler-pot you are using) 
1 Tomato cut up in small pieces 
1 small to medium onion chopped 
2 heaping teaspoons of Baharat spice ground (Garam Masala) 
3 heaping teaspoons of cardomon ground 
3/4 can of tomato paste 
6 teaspoons of olive oil 
1 small snack box of raisins 
1 small chicken cut in sections (a frying chicken will do) 
salt to taste 
1 cinnamon stick 
2 packets (.19 oz each) of &quot;Wyler&apos;s instant beef broth (optional) 
1 dried black lemon 
2 heaping teaspoons powdered garlic 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Thaw chicken according to meat packing directions, wash chicken thoroughly and take the 
skin off the chicken. Set aside skinned chicken, but nolonger than a few minutes so as not to 
promote bacterial growth. 
2. In a large boiler-pot add oil, chopped onions and 1 heaping teaspoon of cardomon stirring 
until browned on medium high heat. 
3. Add boiling water to the boiler-pot until half full. 
4. Add salt accoriding to your own taste, 2 heaping tablespoons of cardomon, 2 heaping 
teaspoons of garlic powder, the cut tomato, 3/4 can of tomato paste, 1 black lemon and 
the raisins to the already browned onions. (adding the 2 packets of &quot;Wyler&apos;s instant beef broth 
at this time is optional). 
5. Stir on medium heat and try a little of the broth (add spices to suit your own taste). 
6. Add chicken to the broth and keep at medium heat. Cover with aluminum foil and then the 
pot lid. 
7. Boil chicken on medium high for approximately 30 minutes. Turn down heat to medium
temperature and take the chicken out of the broth and place in an oven baking dish into 
a preheated oven at 300 degrees F. &amp; bake. 
8. Strain the broth. Keep the strained ingredients in one bowl and the broth in another bowl. 
9. Put the ingredients (e.g. onions, tomato, black lemon, etc.) back into the boiler-pot. 
10. Add the 1 1/2 cups of Basmati rice along with 3 measured cups of the kapsa broth that
you had previously set aside in a bowl. 
11. Bring the Basmati rice, the Kapsa broth and all the ingredients to a boil, then immedietly 
turn down heat to low and cover sealing tightly again with aluminum foil. Cover with a lid over 
the aluminum foil. Do not open or peek at it for atleast 10 minutes. Then periodically check to 
see if rice is light and fluffy, but do not stir rice. 

The Kapsa rice is done when all the broth has been absorbed. Remember to check on the 
chicken in the oven every so often to make sure that it doesn&apos;t overcook and become dry. 
The chicken should be moist. 

Turn off the heat and take off the aluminum foil and allow the extra steam to escape. If the 
Basmati rice appears dry and not completely cooked add a little bit of the extra broth and 
recover until finished. Do not mix the water and rice, just add over the top. 

Serving Directions: 

Pour rice on to a large circular platter. Place the chicken from the oven in the middle and on 
top of the rice. Serve with shattah (hot sauce).

<Ingredients>1/2 quantity of Khoubiz dough recipe*

1 tablespoon vegetable oil

1 # pound of fresh, coarsely ground lamb

1 medium onion, chopped fine

1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

1/2 teaspoon ground allspice

1/4 teaspoon black pepper

1/4 teaspoon white pepper

salt to taste

1/2 cup chopped tomatoes

2 Tablespoons fresh lemon juice

extra vegetable oil

</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Prepare the Khoubiz dough. Set aside to rise 1 1/2 hours (this should become double in size)

Heat the vegetable oil in a heavy large skillet over medium high heat. Add the ground lamb and stir and cook until the meat is crumbly and it is no longer pink. Stir in the chopped onion and cook, stirring until the onion is soft , about 5 minutes. Stir in the pine nuts and all of the spices and seasonings. Stir and cook for one minute. Add the chopped tomatoes. Cover the skillet , reduce the heat to low and cook for 10-15 minutes until the tomato is soft. Remove from heat. Stir in the fresh lemon juice. The mixture should not be watery but it should be moist. Set aside to cool.

Punch down the dough and roll on a lightly floured pastry board till it is 1/4 inch thick. Cut 10 4 inch rounds. Continue to roll the trimmings into a ball, roll them out and cut into rounds also. Place the rounds on a cloth and cover with another cloth.

Take a round of dough and flute the edges with fingertips. Spread a heaping tablespoon of the meat/nut mixture and into the small pie shell you have formed. Place one inch apart on an oil baking sheet. Lightly brush the pies, including the meat and the crust with more oil.

Bake in a pre heated oven at 350 degrees 15 minutes or until the crust is golden.


Best way to eat: Serve hot out of the oven or warm with fresh lemon or plain yogurt.

Cut a piece of bread from the pita so that you can roll the bread around the Kafta (as in a blanket). Add tomatoes, cucumber, lettuce and a generous helping of yogurt on top of the Kafta and eat all together like you would eat a soft tortilla shell. Enjoy this summer dish.

<Ingredients>1/2 ounce active dry yeast
1 teaspoon sugar
2 1/2 cups warm water
8 cups plain flour 
2 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 teaspoons salt
3 tablespoons oil
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Dissolve the yeast in 1/4 cup of the lukewarm water. Stir in the sugar. Set aside in a warm place. Leave it until it begins to rise up and foam. This will take about 15 minutes.

Sift the salt and flour together into a large, warm mixing bowl.. 

Form a well in the center of the flour mixture. Pour the yeast into the center. Gently mix the yeast into the flour. Mix by hand, adding small amounts of warm water if necessary. 

Knead until this becomes a soft dough. Transfer the dough from the bowl to a floured pastry board and continue to knead until it is smooth and shiny. This will take about 15 minutes. Knead 2 tablespoons of oil into the dough. Roll into a large ball. Rub the remaining one tablespoon of oil over the surface of the ball. Return to the bowl. Cover with a moist cloth. Set in a warm place to rise. Leave it about 1 1/2 hours until it doubles in size.

Pre heat the oven to maximum heat at a minimum of 30 minutes before using. Punch down the dough. Pull the edges up to form another ball. Transfer to a lightly floured board and knead 2 minutes. 

Divide into 8 equal portions and roll each portion into a ball. On the floured board flatten each ball and roll with a heavy rolling pin into flat round shapes approximately 1/4 inch or 6mm thick. They should be about 12 inches in diameter. Place the flattened bread rounds on a lightly floured cloth. Cover this with another floured cloth set in a warm spot to rise again to double their size. This should take about 30 minutes. 

Pre heat the baking tray in the oven for 5 minutes. Carefully rub the tray with oil. 

Place one round at a time on the baking tray. Cook 5 - 9 minutes. The bread should swell in the middle and become a light brown in color. Remove from the oven and wrap in a clean cloth to keep moist. The swelling will disappear when the bread is removed from the oven. Continue this procedure with the remaining rounds.

This pita bread is also known as a flat bread.

Pour melted fat over it and roast in a slow oven until meat is very tender and outside well browned. Baste frequently with pan drippings. Or, roast outdoors on a rotisserie over charcoal for best flavor. 

The recipe is adapted to modern cooking devices. It might be cooked most successfully at an outdoor barbecue, although with careful attention and constant basting, the meat can be satisfactorily roasted in the oven. The seasonings which are listed are authentic and all must be used to achieve the correct flavor.

Stuffed kid or baby lamb or sheep is so typical of Saudi Arabian food that no feast, whether a royal affair or a family gathering, will be without it. The meat, surrounded by masses of rice and garnished with hard boiled eggs, is presented to the gathering on a huge tray.</Instructions>

<Author>Unknown (Internet)</Author>
<Ingredients>1 package chicken thighs (6 count) 
1/2 package Hilshire Farms Polish Kielbasa (or other smoked sausage), sliced 
1/2 bell pepper, chopped 
5 stalks celery, chopped 
3 large white onions, chopped (DO NOT use a food processor) 
2 cloves garlic, chopped fine 
1/4 cup peanut oil 
2 cups white rice (regular white rice. NOT Minute rice!!!) 
2 1/2 cups water 1 12oz beer (Budweiser works fine) 
flour to coat chicken 
1 1/2 teaspoons Rosemary 
1 teaspoon Thyme 
A handful of chopped parsley (hard to put too much) 
Salt to taste 
Lots of cayenne pepper 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Start off by washing the chicken and placing it skin side down on a plate (you can remove the skin if you want). Now, depending on how spicy you want it, coat the chicken with Cayenne pepper until very red (I use a LOT of Cayenne in mine). Don&apos;t worry about getting it too hot, since this is the majority of the pepper you are going to add and it will cook into the rest of the dish. Turn the chicken pieces over and lightly coat the skin side. Let sit for 15 minutes or so to soak it all up. Heat the oil in the bottom of a large heavy cast iron or aluminum pot (don&apos;t use thin aluminum or stainless steel since the rice will tend to stick and burn if you&apos;re not really careful). Place the flour in a paper bag (season the flour lightly with salt, cayenne pepper, black pepper, garlic powder, etc). Place a couple of pieces of chicken at a time into the bag and shake to coat. Fry the chicken in the oil until golden brown. Don&apos;t worry about cooking it all the way through just yet. Remove the chicken. Now place the onions, celery, garlic and bell pepper into the pot (along with a bit more oil if necessary) and saute them until the onions are transparent, scraping the bottom of the pot often. Add the rosemary, thyme and parsley and cook for a minute or so. Place the sausage slices, chicken, and a little water into the pot and mix well with the vegetables. Turn heat low, cover and simmer for about 30 minutes (until the chicken is tender). Stir the mixture frequently, always scraping the bottom to keep things from burning (break the chicken up a bit with the spatula as it cooks. It should break up naturally as the dish cooks, but this just helps things a little). When the chicken is cooked, add the washed rice and stir it into everything for a couple of minutes. Pour the warm beer and the water in and stir things for another minute or so. Taste it at this point and adjust the salt if necessary. Now, keeping the heat low, cover the pot and cook until the rice is tender (anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour). Stir the mixture every now and then, scraping the bottom of the pot.</Instructions>

<Ingredients>1 cup chicken (in smallish bite sized pieces) 
½ cup of coconut milk
½ cup makhua puang (Thai eggplant - these are small round eggplants)
3 tablespoons red curry paste (see below)
2 tablespoons nam pla (fish sauce) 
1 tablespoon sweet basil 
1 tablespoon palm sugar
2 kaffir lime leaves (or a little lime zest)
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Cut the chicken up, then briefly fry the curry paste until fragrant, reduce the heat, add the coconut milk slowly, and continue to stir whilst cooking until a thin film of oil apppears on the surface. Skim off the oil, and discard it. Add the chicken and other ingredients except the eggplant. Bring to a boil and cook until the chicken begins to change colour. Adjust the flavors to suit yourself. When it is at a boil again add the eggplant and continue till thechicken is cooked through. Serve with steamed white Jasmine rice. 

The Thai name of this dish literally means &quot;hot red chicken curry&quot;.There is a very similar recipe for a green curry (Gaeng Khiao Wan Kai). Thoughin Thai restaurants in the west, green curry is often the hottest style of curry, as the name indicates, this red curry is generally the hottest inThailand. If you reduce the amount of curry paste to ameliorate the heat, theresulting dish will lose its red coloration. To offset this you can add a littletomato paste to the mixture.

<Ingredients>1 pound of chicken, cut into &quot;bite sized pieces&quot;
5 small potatoes, peeled and partly boiled
5 peeled, but whole, small onions (the type sometimes sold as &quot;pickling onions&quot;) 
3 cups of coconut milk
3 tablespoons palm sugar (you can use a light brown sugar instead if youcan&apos;t get palm sugar) 
3 tablespoons tamarind juice (this is the &quot;sour&quot; ingredient - youcan use white vinegar instead if you can&apos;t get tamarind juice. The juice is madeby soaking tamarind paste in a little water then squeezing it out, and runningit through a sieve to extract the juice from the pulp)
3 tablespoons lime juice 2 tablespoons roasted peanuts (unsalted), broken
1-3 tablespoons masaman curry paste (see below)
1-3 teaspoons crushed garlic
3 bay leaves
5 roasted cardomom fruits (i.e. the whole pod) a small piece of roasted cinnamon bark 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Allow the coconut milk to separate, bu leaving it standing in a cool place,and you will have about 1 cup of thick &quot;cream&quot; and two cups of thin &quot;milk&quot;.In a small saucepan bring the milk to a simmer and add the chicken or pork. If you are using beef you will need another two cups of milk. simmer the meat untilit is beginning to become tender (beef takes longer, hence the additional milk). Put the coconut cream in a wok and bring to a boil, add the masaman pasteand &quot;stir fry&quot; until the flavor is brought out and maximised. The coconut oil will seperate out and can be skimmed off with a spoon or ladle.(this removes much of the vegetable &apos;cholesterol&apos;, and makes the dish much lesstrouble for those watching their weight or heart). Add the remaining cream and curry paste to the meat. Add the peanuts. taste and adjust the flavor until it is (just) sweet (byadding sugar), sour and salty (by adding tamarind juice, lime juiceand fishsauce). Add the remaining ingredients and cook until cooked. Note: The potatoes act as a&quot;moderator&quot; to reduce the heat of the curry, and should not be left out.

The curry paste can be prepared in advance and stored in the fridge in apreserving jar for several weeks or even months. The potatoes used can be &apos;normal&apos; western style potatoes, or any of thesweet potatoes. (I prefer the latter, as it seems to complement the flavour ofthe curry, and western style potatoes are for from common, and quite expensivein Thailand, so clearly not the normal authentic component of the dish). This recipe can also be prepared with pork (kaeng masaman mu) or beef (kaengmasaman nuea). A recipe for the masaman curry paste can be found below.</Instructions>

<Name>Pea Soup</Name>
<Author>The Santesson Recipe Collection </Author>
<Ingredients>Ingredients: 
500 grams yellow split peas 
1.5 - 2 litres of water or vegetable bouillon (can be made from bouillon cubes!) 
2 finely chopped onions 
20 - 30 grams of fresh, whole ginger 
5 - 10 grams of majoram or thyme or both 
optional: potatoes 
optional: carrots 
optional: 500 grams of diced bacon 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Proceed as follows:
Soak the yellow split peas in water for at least 12 hours. Discard the water (even though some insist you should use this water for the soup). 
Boil the peas, bouillon, onion and ginger for at least 90 minutes. Now and then, carefully skim off the pea hulls as they float up to the surface. When 15 - 30 minutes remain of the cooking time, add the majoram and/or thyme. 
The optional ingredients should be added at a late stage during the cooking. Potatoes and carrots will require 20 - 25 minutes of cooking, the bacon at least 30 minutes 
Taste, add salt if required. 
The pea soup is often served together with some mustard. A very (old) Swedish tradition is also to serve it together with hot punsch, an arrak-based, intensely sweet liquor. However, beer will do fine as a substitute.


</Instructions>
<Serves>1</Serves>
<Notes>During centuries, the pea soup prepared from yellow split peas was served every Thursday. Only during the second half of the 20th century has this tradition begun to disappear. The pea soup is best when cooked on very large scale; thus, the version served in the Army has a well-deserved good reputation since it is normally cooked in 200 litres batches. But you might want to try it on a somewhat smaller scale...</Notes>

<Notes>A completely different origin of the dish has been suggested by Suzanne Koski in an e-mail: &quot;According to Craig Claiborne, Pastor Jansson brought his flock to Bishop Hill, Illinois in the mid-19th century.

The story goes that the dish went back to Sweden with disallusioned followers (perhaps the woman who originated the dish).&quot; </Notes>

3 - 5 kg of salt-cured fresh ham (do NOT use dried cured ham) 
1 egg 
2 tablespoons mustard 
1 tablespoon sugar 
3 tablespoons breadcrumbs 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Proceed as follows:
Depending upon the method of salt curing it might be necessary to leave the ham overnight covered with water to desalt it. 
Pre-heat the oven to 125 oC (240 oF). Insert an oven thermometer in the thickest part of the ham. Leave it in the oven until the temperature reaches 75 oC (167 oF). 
Remove the rind carefully and as much of the fat as you like. (With less fat left it is healthier but drier!) 
Heat the oven to 225 oC (450 oF). 
Mix egg, mustard and sugar. 
Place the ham on a roasting-pan, cover it with the mixture and sift the breadcrumbs over if. They should stick to the egg-mustard mixture. 
Bake the ham for 10 minutes in the oven. When ready, it should have a golden colour with a few deep brown but no black patches. 

If you&apos;re not going to use it as the centrepiece on the buffet table you can serve it together with potatoes, red cabbages, mustard and stewed and mashed apples.

1 1/4 cup all purpose flour

100 g smoked ham 
100 g bacon 
salt, pepper 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Proceed as follows:
Mash the potatoes. Put it on a breadboard and make a small pit in the middle. 
Put eggs, flour and salt in the pit and work the potato-dough fast together. Too much kneading makes the potato tough. 
Chop finely the onion, cut the bacon and ham into small pieces and fry it until it gets coloured. Flavour it with white pepper. 
Form the potato-dough to a thick roll. Cut it in thick slices and put a pile of bacon mix in a pit in a slice, then put another slice on top of it, press the edges together and roll it to a ball. 
Lower the balls in boiling salted water and boil them approx. 10-12 minutes or until they float to the surface. Pick them up with a perforated ladle and put them on a hot serving plate. Don’t boil too many at a time, they will then have some difficulty to float to the surface.

<Notes>&quot;Ostkaka&quot;, cheesecake, is a traditional dish from the province of Småland in southern Sweden. Swedes normally do not prepare the dish themselves but buy it ready-made. However, &quot;ostkaka&quot; is not easily available outside Sweden; hence we have included a recipe (which should serve 15-20 persons as a dessert) for those who would like to try. </Notes>

4 dl cooked white rice, cold and soft 
2 dl whipped cream, whipped to a volume of 4-5 dl 
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 
1 tablespoon sugar 
1 orange, peeled and cut in very small pieces and/or

<Instructions>Proceed as follows:
In a closed large glass jar place the 96 % alcohol at the bottom. 
Place 0.5-1 kilograms of black currants in a gauze bag and suspend this bag over the alcohol. It is important that the black currants are NOT in any way submerged in the alcohol. 
Leave the jar closed in a warm place for at least two months. After that time most of the aroma will have evaporated from the black currants and dissolved in the alcohol, however the pigment still remain in the currants.

<Author>The Santesson Recipe Collection </Author>
<Ingredients>Ingredients: 
1 kg (2 lbs) of berries, e.g. black or red currants, cherries, raspberries, strawberries, etc. 
300 - 600 ml (1 - 2 cups) of water 
300 - 600 ml (1 - 2 cups) of granulated sugar 
5 grams of sodium benzoate to preserve the &quot;saft&quot; 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Proceed as follows:
Clean the berries. The pit can stay in cherries; black and red currants can remain as racemes. 
Weight the berries and determine the water quantity. Black and red currants require the largest water quantity, strawberries, cherries, and raspberries require less water. 
Boil the berries in the water under cover for 10 minutes. Squeeze them now and then with, e.g. a wooden spoon in order to make certain they are crushed. 
Now comes the tricky part: You have to strain the &quot;saft&quot;, using a straining-cloth. Do not apply pressure, but let gravity do the trick. This part of the preparation might take up to an hour. 
Measure the quantity of &quot;saft&quot;, bring it to the boil and add the sugar. If required, carefully skim off any scum. 
Add the sodium benzoate if desired (first dissolve it in a small quantity of saft, then add the solution to the rest of the &quot;saft&quot;). 
Fill the &quot;saft&quot; into hot, clean bottles and seal the bottles immediately (e.g. using cork). Before serving, mix the fruit-syrup with water to desired strength.

Add either the olive oil or the creme fraiche and continue puréing until you have a smooth paste.
The dip mix based on olive oil is the original one. Substituting olive oil by creme fraiche results in a dip mix with a softer taste and smoother texture. Both forms have plenty of applications in the hors d&apos;oevre context. They will keep for up to week in the refrigerator but usually they have been devoured long before that.

During lunch hours an hourglass is turned over when the first course arrives. Within an hour you must have finished your lunch! </Notes>

<Name>Pine Nut Soup</Name>
<Author>The Santesson Recipe Collection </Author>
<Ingredients>Ingredients: 
100 g pine nuts 
3 egg yolks 
250 ml chicken bouillon 
250 ml cream 
saffron, ouzo or cayenne pepper </Ingredients>
<Instructions>Proceed as follows:
Purée a mixture of the pine nuts and the egg yolks in the food processor until you have a fine, smooth paste. 
Put this in a saucepan and add one cup of chicken bouillon and one cup of cream. The chicken stock can be added already at the food processor stage if you have difficulties in obtaining a smooth paste.This far the dish can be prepared hours in advance. 
Heat over a gentle fire under constant stirring until the mixture thickens. It must not, however, be brought to a boil! 
Serve immediately. 
If desired, the aphrodisiac properties can be reinforced by suitable spices. I have tried three equally successful alternatives: 0.5 grams of finely divided saffron, two tablespoons of ouzo and a pinch of cayenne pepper. The spice (but only one of them!) is added before the soup is heated. Especially the saffron gives the dish a pleasing reddish colour.

Heat the mixture in a pan at low-moderate heat while constantly stirring until the mixture thickens. 
Pre-heat the other half of the shelled shrimps for 40 seconds in the microwave oven. 
Add the pre-heated shrimps to the soup. 
Serve immediately. 
If possible serve together with some black lumpfish roe on the side and white toasted bread. 
A variation is purée all the shrimps and serve the soup as a fish dish sauce.

<Name>Chicken Bokchoy Dolma</Name>
<Author>The Santesson Recipe Collection </Author>
<Ingredients>Ingredients: 
150 grams chicken (or turkey) breast 
40 grams brie cheese 
1 egg 
2-4 bokchoy leaves 
10 green olives (filled with red bell pepper) 
oregano 
pepper, salt 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Proceed as follows:
Cut away the coarsest central white part from the bottom of the bokchoy leaves. Cover the leaves with cotton cloth and microwave them at high for 1 minute per 100 grams. 
Purée chicken breast, egg and cheese, together with oregano, pepper and salt in a food processor until you have a smooth paste. 
Place 1-2 parboiled bokchoy leaves on a carving board. Form the chicken paste into a loaf-like sausage and place this on top of the bokchoy leaf/leaves. Press the olives into the &quot;sausage&quot;. Roll the leaf/leaves around the &quot;sausage&quot; to form a dolma. 
Place another 1-2 parboiled bokchoy leaves on the carving board, put the dolma on top of the leaf/leaves and roll it/them around the dolma. 
Firmly roll a cotton cloth around the dolma to ensure that it will keep it&apos;s shape during the cooking. 
Microwave at LOW for 10 minutes. Leave to cool. 
The chicken paksoi dolma is best served cool, cut in thin slices, as a starter together with more olives and some colourful vegetables. The above quantity is sufficient for two persons. You can double the recipe and still make only one dolma, but if you go beyond that it is better to make several dolmas. An alternative to the use of cotton cloth in step 5 is to use leek. Cook a long leek at high for 1 minute per 80 grams, then cut it into thin long strips. Wrap these strips around the &quot;dolma sausage&quot; to ensure that the cover bokchoy leaves do not unwrap

</Instructions>
<Serves>0</Serves>
<Notes>We started to experiment with bokchoy (nappa cabbage, a form of Chinese cabbage, in Dutch paksoi) recently, and we have found it quite a versatile vegetable, One interesting use is as covering leave in dishes of the dolma type (a leaf-covered stuffing). Generally, it is easier to handle for this purpose than either wine leaves or cabbage. </Notes>

<Instructions>Proceed as follows:
Finely chop the shallots, e.g. using a food processor. Fry gently in olive oil in a frying pan until the shallot pieces have softened; they must not, however, turn brown. 
Mix the fried shallots with the minced veal, the eggs, the mustard, the capers and some salt and pepper in a bowl. 
Cover a plate with a thin film of olive oil. Transfer the meat mixture from the bowl to the plate and form it into an oversized burger with the same diameter as the frying pan. 
Let the burger slide from the plate into the heated frying pan. Fry for about 4 minutes. 
Remove the frying pan from the heat. Put the plate on top of it. Turn frying pan and plate upside down so that the burger will end up on the plate. Take another plate, cover it with a film of olive oil. put it on top of the plate with the burger, turn the two plates upside down. 
You should now have the burger on the second plate with the fried side up. Let it slide back into the frying pan. Fry the burger for another 4 minutes. 
Divide the burger in two halves and serve together with, e.g. mashed potatoes and a salad.

250 ml dry white wine 
1 tbsp butter 
25-50 grams beurre manié (a mixture of equal parts of all-purpose flour and butter)

Prepare the bouillon from boullion cubes or powder but use white wine instead of water. 
Melt the butter in a pan. When the butter is slowly turning dark yellowish, fry the fish fillet cubes for one minute, then add the bouillon and let the fish cubes simmer for a few minutes. 
Remove the pan from the heat and decant the liquid into another pan. 
Bring the liquid to a boil and add small quantities of beurre manié while constantly stirring until you have a rather viscous sauce. Remove the pan from the heat and pour the sauce over the fish cubes in the first pan.

250 g fillets of a fish with firm, white meat, cut into 6 pieces 
250 g fresh mushrooms 
25-50 g crushed garlic cloves 
3-5 tbsp dry white wine or vermouth 
extra virgin olive oil for frying 
spices: salt, estragon, black pepper as desired 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Proceed as follows:
Divide the mushrooms into 2 - 4 pieces. 
Heat the oil to about 160 oC in a frying pan (at this temperature butter starts to acquire a nut brown colour and a piece of white bread dropped into the oil turns golden brown within 15 - 30 seconds). 
Fry the mushroom pieces together with the crushed garlic until the mushrooms begin to turn brownish (it takes at least 3 - 4 minutes, if necessary, lower the temperature after a few minutes). 
Remove the mushrooms from the frying pan but leave any garlic residues in the pan. 
Add the fish pieces, kind of stir-fry them for 15 - 30 seconds, then add the wine and bring to a boil for another 15 - 30 seconds. 
Return the mushroom pieces to the frying pan and let the mixture simmer for one minute.

<Notes>You can combine garlic and fish! One extreme is to serve fish filled with garlic (bake plenty of garlic cloves in the oven at 250 oC for 10 minutes, then stuff, e.g. a cod, laithe or similar fish with the baked cloves and bake the stuffed fish at 200 oC for another 25-50 minutes, depending on size).

<Name>Basic Aphrodisiac Mussels</Name>
<Author>The Santesson Recipe Collection </Author>
<Ingredients>Ingredients: 
3 kilograms (7 lbs) of mussels, cleaned 
350 grams (12 oz) onion, coarsely chopped 
300 grams (10 oz) celery, coarsely chopped 
250 grams (8 oz) shallots, coarsley chopped 
2 garlic cloves (10-15 grams), finely chopped 
3 fish bouillon cubes (intended for 750 ml/3 cups of bouillon) 
1 teaspoon dry thyme leaves 
1 teaspoon dry basil leaves 
1 bottle (750 ml) of dry white wine 
3 grams saffron (the quantity can be reduced) </Ingredients>
<Instructions>Proceed as follows:
Let the vegetables and the garlic simmer in the white wine for 15-20 minutes in a pan with a volume of 4-6 litres. At a late stage add the thyme and the basil. 
Increase the heat, place half of the mussels on top of the vegetables and let them steam until they have opened. This should take about 5 minutes. 
Remove the steamed mussels using a perforated ladle and set them apart. Place the remaining half of the mussels on top of the vegetables and let them steam for another five minutes until they all have opened. Remove them and add them to the first mussel batch. 
Sieve the liquid to remove the vegetables, let the sieved bouillon boil for 5-10 minutes to reduce the volume somewhat, then leave it to cool. When cool, add the saffron. 
Remove the mussels from the shells. Keep them separated from the bouillon.
Now you have the starting materials for a number of delicious dishes, e.g. mussel soup, diet mussel soup, mussel pasta sauce and mussel risotto. You can put the mussels and the bouillon in the deep-freeze for use later on; if so we suggest you pack in separate plastic bags about 100 grams of mussels per bag and 250 ml (1 cup) of bouillon) per bag. Otherwise you can use the ingredients almost immediately, but remember that the saffron will require a few hours to merge with the bouillon!

<Notes>This recipe is the starting point for a few mussel dishes with a truly aphrodisiac touch.

125 ml (1/2 cup) whipping cream 
1 egg yolk 
fresh pasta as desired, e.g. linguine or a similar band pasta that can well carry the the chopped mussels </Ingredients>
<Instructions>Proceed as follows:
Chop half of the mussels coarsely. 
In a large pan (there should be space enough also for the pasta), mix the whipping cream and the bouillon; heat until a slow boil, add the chopped mussels and let the mixture simmer for a few minutes. 
Remove the sauce from the heat, add the egg yolk while stirring. 
Continue the heating at a very low heat (the sauce must never boil!) until the whole mussels have absorbed enough saffron taste. 
Meanwhile, cook the fresh pasta. The cooking time will depend on the type of pasta you have chosen. 
Drain the pasta, then add it to the mussel sauce, stir, add the remaining unchopped mussels, and continue stirring at very low heat for a minute or two. Serve immediately. 
The selection of pasta is important. Do not use a dry type pasta; the flavor of the mussel sauce is too delicate. Also, stay away from very thin fresh pasta since that requires a creamy sauce without any solid particles.

6-10 garlic cloves, finely chopped (this is one secret ingredient!) 
a small onion, finely chopped 
100-200 ml dry white wine 
0.5 g saffron (this is the other secret ingredient) 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Proceed as follows:
Clean the mussels and discard those that appear to be dead, i.e. will not close their shells when a friendly pressure has been applied a few times. Parboil the veggie mix in the microwave oven at full power (700 W), 1.5 minutes for every 100 grammes of vegetables. 
Transfer the vegetables to a 6 liter casserole, add the wine, the saffron and the mussels and bring to a boil. 
Stir now and then (about every 10 seconds), using a wooden fork if available, until all the mussels have opened (this should only take a few minutes). The dish is now ready to be served. 
The mussels can best be served together with toast, aïoli and, if available, zeekraal. The easiest way to eat the mussels is to use a pair of empty mussel shells as tweezers to pick the mussel meat out of the shells.

1-2 finely chopped red jalapeño peppers 
1-2 crushed garlic cloves 
5-10 g crushed coriander seeds 
salt and black pepper as required

<Instructions>Proceed as follows:
Cut the fish filets into 1.5 - 2 cm pieces. Place them in bowl that is not too large for the refrigerator. Add the jalapeño peppers, garlic and coriander and pour the lemon juice on top of the mixture. The juice should cover the fish pieces, if not they will have to be compressed. 
If so desired also the vegetables can be added to the fish-lemon-spice mixture. This is specially recommended if you intend to serve the dish as the main course during a lunch on a hot summer day.

Leave the bowl for at least 3, if possible 4 - 6 hours in the refrigerator. The fish flesh should be white and opaque and not translucent any more when the &quot;cooking&quot; is complete. 
Serve together with a cold beer (Corona?) and toasted bread or baguette.

<Notes>We came across this dish when we spent two weeks at White Sands hotel, 20 kms north of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. We found it so delicious that we had it three times during that period. Back in the Netherlands, of course we started to try to copy the dish.
If you can get hold of a really ripe and succulent pineapple, we believe our copy is as good as the original. When eating it, you start to dream of the beach at the Indian Ocean...</Notes>

<Author>The Santesson Recipe Collection </Author>
<Ingredients>Ingredients: 
500 grams trout (or other salmon type fish) 
100 grams boiled potatoes 
150 ml freshly pressed lemon juice 
3 tbsp cognac 
2 tbsp molten butter 
2 avocados 
cayenne pepper 
black pepper, salt 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Proceed as follows:
Cook any salmon type fish, e.g. trout, in the microwave oven: 1 minute at high for every 100 grams. Remove skin, bones, tail and head, and let the meat cool. About 300 grams of meat should remain. 
Purée the trout meat together with cooked potatoes, freshly pressed lemon juice, cognac and molten butter in a food processor. 
Add the flesh of 1 1/2 peeled avocado, a very generous pinch of cayenne pepper and pinches of salt and black pepper. 
Purée for another 15-30 seconds. 
Transfer the mousse to a suitable bowl and let it cool for at least a few hours in the refrigerator. 
Serve the mousse together with lumpfish roe in canapés or on toast, using the remaining 1/2 avocado cut in thin slices as a decor.
An alternative is to take the mousse bowl, sit down upon a bed and spoon-feed each other. In this case the roe should be excluded.

<Author>Robb Satterwhite and Kenji Mitsuyama</Author>
<Ingredients>Ingredients: 

200g chopped boiled octopus 
cooking oil 
benishoga (pickled ginger) (to taste) 
chopped negi (or scallions) (to taste) 
tenkasu (or rice crispies) (to taste) 

[Batter]: 
450cc water 
1 piece konbu (kelp), 10cm square 
15g powdered katsuo-bushi (shaved dried bonito) 
200g flour 
2 eggs 

[Sauce]: 
commercial takoyaki sauce 
or worcestershire sauce 
or bulldog sauce 
or mayonnaise (Best Foods or Hellman&apos;s) 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Directions -- batter
1. Clean the konbu by wiping it lightly with a cloth.
2. Cut the konbu into 2-centimeter-wide partial strips against the grain, but don&apos;t cut all the way to the edge -- see illustration.
3. Add the water and konbu to a pot, and cook uncovered over a slow fire.
4. Just before the water starts to boil, remove the konbu from the pot. The liquid should be a light yellowish or greenish color. 
5. Add shaved katsuobushi to the water as it starts to boil.
6. After the liquid has been boiling a minute or two, turn off the heat.
7. Quickly remove the shaved katsuobushi from the liquid with a filter or strainer or cloth. Try to remove the katsuobushi while it&apos;s still floating on the surface, before it has a chance to sink.
8. Allow the liquid to cool, then add the liquid, flour and eggs to a bowl and mix.


Directions -- takoyaki

Make a small test batch of 4 or 5 takoyaki at first, to check the consistency of the batter. Add more flour or water as needed. 

1. Oil the takoyaki pan.
2. Add pieces of chopped octopus to each cup.
3. Pour in the batter.
4. Add benishoga, negi and tenkasu to taste.
5. Cook the takoyaki pieces until they achieve the desired degree of firmness, turning them over frequently.
6. Remove from the pan and serve with sauce and/or mayonnaise. </Instructions>

<Author>Hiroyuki Sato</Author>
<Ingredients>Ingredients: 
4 slices pork sirloin, 1/2 - 3/4 lb. each (about 1 inch thick) 
1 egg, beaten 
2 cups bread crumbs 
1 cup flour 
Peanut or canola oil for deep frying 

1 lemon (optional) 
Hot yellow mustard 

Tonkatsu sauce or subsititute

Use your favorite steak sauce and mix with ketchup to sweeten. You can also mix in lemon juice, to add a touch of sourness. A-1 or 76 steak sauce, or even Worcestershire sauce alone, goes well, too. 
Garnish 

Thin slices of cabbage or lettuce leaves. 
To prepare cabbage slices: Thin-slice 8 cabbage leaves and soak in cold water. Drain well and use them as a garnish for the tonkatsu. 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>This recipe also works very well with beef, chicken, oysters, and large shrimps or prawns.

Japanese-style potato salad [recipe here at this site] goes very well with this dish. Coleslaw would be nice, too. Also, Japanese or Chinese yellow (hot) mustard can give some sensation to your taste buds. 

Here are the ingredients and directions. You can prepare biifu-katsu (beef cutlet) using the same directions. 

Directions:

Tenderize the meat and flatten to about 1/2 inch thick. Season the pork with salt and pepper. Coat the meat with flour and shake off the excess. Dip the meat into the egg, then the bread crumbs on a platter. Chill the meat in the freezer for 20 minutes or in the refrigerator for 2 hours. This chilling process gives the tonkatsu a crispy crust. Deep-fry (350F) until each side is light to medium golden brown. Drain the oil well and serve with the garnish. Slices of tomato will add some color.</Instructions>
<Serves>4</Serves>
<Notes>To tonkatsu-fry seafood or other types of meat, follow the same directions. Of course, you have to peel the shells of shrimps. Oysters are our favorite choice. In Japan a bowl of miso soup usually comes with this dish. Bon Appetit! </Notes>

<Name>Inside-out California Rolls </Name>
<Author>Katsuji Yamamoto and Roger Hicks </Author>
<Ingredients>Ingredients: 
Clingfilm 
3 half-size sheets seaweed paper 
1 quantity sushi rice 
Japanese horseradish 
Thinly sliced cucumber 
Flesh of 1 avocado 
150g / 5 oz crab meat 
Toasted sesame seeds and roe (optional), to garnish </Ingredients>
<Instructions>As its name suggests, California Roll is hardly a classical sushi recipe. It is, however, extremely popular across the United States and elsewhere. It is a superb blend of textures - cooked crab, avocado and cucumber. 

Although it is quite possible to make a small roll with sparing amounts of these fillings, inside-out rolls allow for generous servings. A vegetarian version of the California Roll can be made using a combination of cucumber, cooked dried gourd, thinly sliced parboiled carrot, mangetouts and cream cheese! 

To prepare the avocado, halve it, cutting around the stone. Remove the stone and using a large spoon scoop out the flesh from each half in one piece. Slice into strips. 

1. Cover the sushi mat with Clingfilm. Lay the seaweed paper on top and cover with a thin layer of sushi rice. Dip your fingers in a bowl of rice vinegar-water, then lightly press the rice with your fingers to secure it to the seaweed. 
 
2. Turn the seaweed paper and rice over on the covered mat. Smear the seaweed paper with a little Japanese horseradish. 
 
3. Top with cucumber, avocado and crab meat. 
 
4. Carefully start to roll the mat, using your fingers and palms to keep the mat even and the ingredients in place. 
 
5. Compress and shape the roll. 
 
6. Unroll the mat and remove the Clingfilm, then sprinkle with sesame seeds and roe before cutting into six pieces. Repeat to make 2 more rolls.

4 cups water 
2 teaspoons dashi (nomoto) 
3-4 tablespoons miso (adjust to taste) 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>This soup is served every morning in Japan, with the flavors of seasonal vegetables. There are several different kinds of miso paste available in the United States. Shiro-miso paste is a mild one and is low in salt. On the other hand, aka-miso is very salty and has a different, stronger fragrance than shiro-miso. Miso soup base is made out of a fish stock called dashi. You can purchase dashi at any Oriental food shop. You can enjoy almost any vegetable with this soup, from lettuce to snow pea pods. Here&apos;s a list of vegetables you might want to try in the miso soup. 

Directions:
Boil 4 cups of water and dashi. Add tofu and mushrooms, simmer gently about 3 minutes. Add miso and dissolve completely. Immediately turn off the heat and add chopped green onions, then serve</Instructions>

<Author>Daniel Boulud</Author>
<Ingredients>1 tablespoon vegetable oil
six 7-ounce hanger steaks 
salt and freshly ground white pepper 
2 tablespoons unsalted butter 
8 medium shallots, peeled, trimmed, thinly sliced, rinsed, and dried 
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar 
1/2 cup dry red wine 
2 tablespoons finely chopped Italian parsley leaves </Ingredients>
<Instructions>Heat a large heavy-bottomed sauté pan or skillet over high heat, then add the oil. When the oil is hot, season the steaks with salt and pepper, slip them into the pan, and brown evenly, turning as needed, until they&apos;re done the way you like them — 6 minutes total will give you a medium-rare steak (remember, the steaks will continue cooking while they rest); cook the steaks a minute longer for medium and 2 to 3 minutes longer for well-done. Transfer the steaks to a heated serving dish and set them aside in a warm place while you make the shallots.

Place the pan you used to cook the steaks over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon of the butter and the shallots. Season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring, for 3 to 5 mintues, until the shallots are softened but not colored. Add the vinegar and cook until it evaporates, then add the wine. Bring the wine to the boil and allow it to cook down until it is reduced by half. Pull the pan from the heat and swirl in the remaining 1 tablespoon butter, then stir in the chopped parsley.

To serve: Cut each steak on the bias into thin slices and, for each serving, fan the slices out on a warm dinner plate. Drizzle the warm shallot sauce over the meat and serve immediately. 

</Instructions>

<Notes>To my way of thinking, the traditional way of serving hanger steak is the best. The steaks are quickly pan-roasted  they&apos;re best served medium-rare (although in France they&apos;re often served &quot;bleu,&quot; so rare that they&apos;re almost blue and only just warm in the center) and sauced with shallots that have been cooked to a compote&apos;s consistency with red wine and vinegar and then tossed with butter and herbs. Whether you sauce the steaks or not (sometimes small bistros in France will serve the steaks with just a spoonful of butter and some sea salt or a pot of strong mustard), I hope you&apos;ll serve them with the greatest and most classic accompaniment: pommes frites, French-fried potatoes. </Notes>

<Notes>This pasta along with All&apos;Amatriciana and their variations are favorites in Roman trattorias. All&apos;Amatriciana , with little pieces of cured pork in the sauce, comes from the Abruzzese town of Amatrice. So do many of the hosts of the old Roman trattorias, Osterias, and tavole calde, where Romans take their meals, and so all&apos;amatriciana has become a Roman style of pasta.Penne all&apos;arrabbiata, without the cured pork, simply means &quot;enraged pasta,&quot; referring to the heat of the peppers, which are also valuable for restoring flagging energies, see the puttanesca recipe. The popularity of these pastas has benefited considerably from the nostalgie de la boue that from time to time afflicts upper-class Romans, intellectuals, film people, and aristocrats, who frequent working-class eating places at times of the night when the working classes are soundly asleep-a bit like Parisian partygoers slumming for bowls of soupe a` l&apos;oignon at five o&apos;clock in the morning.

<Name>Fettucine con aspergi e ricotta </Name>
<Author>Mediterranean Diet Cookbook</Author>
<Ingredients>3/4 pound tender young asparagus (or other spring vegetable or tasty frozen vegetable
1 garlic clove, crushed with the flat blade of a knife
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons minced fresh mint
2 tablespoons minced fresh green wild fennel if available
1 pound fettuccine
salt to taste
6 quarts water
4 T fresh creamy ricotta or mild goat cheese (chevre)
a little freshly grated nutmeg if desired
freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup freshly grated young pecorino or Parmigiano cheese

</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Trim off the tough ends of the asparagus stalks and cut the tender parts into 2-inch lengths. In a saute&apos; pan, gently stew the garlic clove and asparagus in the oil until the vegetables are tender but not brown-about 15 minutes. Stir in the mint and, if you can find it, the wild fennel. Set aside.

Meanwhile, cook the pasta in lightly salted water. While the pasta cooks, extract about ½ cup of the cooking liquid and mix it in a small saucepan with the ricotta. Set the saucepan over low heat and gently cream the ricotta with the cooking liquid. when the ricotta is warm, taste and add salt and a little pepper. If you don&apos;t have wild fennel, add grated nutmeg if you wish to the cheese sauce.

Drain the pasta and combine immediately with the cheese sauce, tossing to mix well. Arrange on a warm platter and pour the asparagus, garlic, and oil over the top. Sprinkle a few tablespoons of grated cheese over and serve immediately, passing the rest of the grated cheese at the table.

<Notes>You can vary the vegetable in this springtime pasta - fresh young peas are delicious, as are small artichoke hearts or very tender young fava beans if you can find or grow them. Just be sure that the raw, prepared vegetable weighs about 3/4 pound - that is, shelled peas or fava beans, artichoke hearts trimmed down to their cooking size.

Most cooks will not be able to find wild fennel, but those in northern California and other parts of the country where this delightfully fragrant herb grows on the edge of highways and in abandoned lots should take the opportunity to use the green tops. Don&apos;t substitute fennel seeds or cultivated fennel - the flavor is too crude.

<Ingredients>5 ounces homestyle Bread, (about 5 slices)
1/2 cup whole blanched almonds, coarsely chopped
2 large garlic cloves, Pressed
1 small all-purpose potato, peeled, boiled and drained
3 tablespoons lemon juice
3 tablespoons white-wine vinegar
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon sugar

</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Trim the crusts from the bread and spread the slices out on a tray to dry for about 24 hours.

In the container of a food processor, place the almonds, garlic, and cooled potato. Process until smooth.

Mix the lemon juice, vinegar, olive oil, salt, and sugar in a small bowl and set aside. Fill a large bowl with cool water. Drop the dried bread into the water, 1 slice at a time. When it is soaked,
squeeze about half the water from the bread between the palms of your hands. Add the bread to the ingredients in the processor, alternating with the lemon-juice mixture, and process until smooth. 
Since the skordalia has a tendency to stiffen and become pasty as it chills, the mixture should be quite loose at this point. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Scrape the mixture into a bowl. Cover
and refrigerate for several hours to allow the flavors to mellow and blend. If the mixture seems too stiff, beat in a little water before serving.

1/4 teaspoon salt 
  Pepper, to taste 
Pinch cayenne (optional) 
3 1/2 pound chicken, cut into 8 pieces (or chicken legs) 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Spray a roasting rack with nonstick spray &amp; place it in a foil-lined roasting pan.

Pulse the pretzels in a food processor or blender until coarsely crumbed (some small pea-size crumbs should remain), with the motor running, drizzle in the oil and pulse just to mix well. Transfer to a wide, shallow bowl or pie plate.

Whisk together the eggs, mustard, thyme, marjoram, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and cayenne in another bowl or pie plate.

Working one at a time, dip the chicken pieces with one hand into the egg mix to coat, then place in the crumb mixture. Use your other hand to press the crumbs into the chicken on all sides, turning to coat well. Shake off the excess crumbs and place the chicken on the prepared rack. Bake until the chicken is cooked through and juices run clear when pierced with a fork, about 45 minutes.

<Ingredients>1 large egg 
 water 
1/3 cup unsifted all-purpose flour 
2 teaspoons salt 
1 pound pork tenderloin cutlets, 1/8 inch thick 
4 tablespoons butter or margarine 
12 ounce package fresh spinach fettuccine 
2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese 
1/3 cup dark seedless raisins 
1 chicken-flavored bouillon cube or 1 envelope chicken-flavored bouillon 
1 tablespoon brown sugar 
1 teaspoon julienne lemon zest 
1/2 cup dry vermouth 
1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice 
1 tablespoon minced parsley 
2 small acorn squash, sliced and steamed until tender 
 Sauteed Cherry Tomatoes (see Vegetable section of Recipe File) 
1 parsley sprig for garnish 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. In a pie plate, using a wire whisk or fork, beat egg with 1 tablespoon water until thoroughly blended. Set aside. On a sheet of waxed paper, mix the flour with 1/2 teaspoon salt. Dip one pork cutlet into egg mixture until thoroughly coated; drain off excess.
2. Coat the egg-dipped cutlet thoroughly with flour mixture; shake off excess flour mixture. Place flour-coated cutlet on plate. Repeat with remaining pork cutlets, first dipping each into the egg and then coating with flour mixture.
3. In 12 inch skillet, over medium heat, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter. Add pork cutlets, several at a time, and saute 2 minutes on each side. Place cooked cutlets on a heated serving platter; cover loosely with aluminum foil to keep warm. Repeat until all cutlets are cooked.
4. While cutlets cook, in a large saucepan, over high heat, bring 3 quarts water and remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons salt to boiling. Add fettuccine and cook 3 to 5 minutes or until al dente; that is, cooked but firm to the bite. Drain and toss with remaining butter and the Parmesan cheese. Cover to keep warm.
5. In the skillet used for cooking the cutlets, over medium high heat, bring 1/2 cup water, the raisins, bouillon cube, brown sugar, lemon zest, vermouth, and lemon juice to boiling. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring constantly, to reduce liquid in skillet to 3/4 cup.
6. Arrange cutlets on warmed serving dish. Top with sauce and sprinkle with minced parsley. Surround with fettuccine and slices of steamed acorn squash. Garnish with Sauteed Cherry Tomatoes and a sprig of parsley.</Instructions>

1 large onion, chopped, about 1 cup 
3 garlic cloves, minced, about 1 tbsp 
1 tart apple, such as Granny Smith, peeled and diced, about 1 cup 
2 medium-size bananas, chopped, about 1 1/2 cups 
1 large tomato, diced, about 1 1/2 cups 
2 tablespoons mild or medium curry powder or 1 tbsp (15 mL) hot curry powder 
2 teaspoons turmeric 
1/2 teaspoon each of ground cumin and ground coriander 
1 cup low-sodium diluted chicken broth or chicken stock 
1 cup plain yogurt, preferably low fat 
1 tablespoons all-purpose flour 
  Salt to taste 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. In a very large saucepan or Dutch oven, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat. Add half of chicken pieces and cook, turning once, until brown, about 3 minutes per side. Remove to a large plate. Repeat with remaining oil and chicken. Remove all chicken and set aside.

2. Reduce heat to medium. Add onion and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is soft, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare apple, bananas and tomato.

3. Sprinkle onion with curry powder, turmeric, cumin and coriander. Saute, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Add apple, bananas, tomato and broth. Bring to a boil, scraping up brown bits from bottom of pan.

4. Reduce heat to medium and simmer, uncovered and stirring frequently, until liquid is reduced by about half, from 5 to 10 minutes. Return chicken and any juices to pan and simmer, covered but stirring occasionally, until juices run clear when chicken is pierced with a fork, about 30 minutes.

5. Stir yogurt with flour until smooth. Stir into chicken mixture. To blend flavours, simmer, uncovered and stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes. Taste and add salt, if you like. Tightly covered, this dish will keep well in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.

<Ingredients>8 Chinese or Japanese shiitake mushrooms soaked in 1 cup hot water for 20 -30 minutes, or until soft 
3-3 1/2 pound chicken, washed and cut into 8 -10 pieces 
2 scallions, cut into 2&quot; lengths (green part only) 
2 thin slices ginger, peeled 
2 cups Chinese cabbage (also called celery or lettuce cabbage), cut into 1&quot; pieces 
1 cup chicken broth 
1 tablespoon reduced-sodium soy sauce 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Squeeze the mushrooms dry. Remove the stems and cut into quarters. Strain the liquid and set aside.
2. In a deep bowl arrange the chicken, mushrooms, scallions, ginger, and cabbage. Combine the chicken broth with the reserved mushroom liquid and soy sauce. Pour over the ingredients in the bowl.
3. Fit the bowl in a large pot filled with 2&quot; to 3 &quot; of hot water with a rack supporting the bowl. Cover the pot and cook the chicken over medium-high heat for about 1 1/2 hours, or until the chicken is tender and firm, but not falling apart. ( The water level should be checked every 30 minutes to maintain constant steam, but if you remove the lid too often the escaping steam will slow the cooking process.)
If cooking in a Yunnan pot, arrange the chicken around the cone, top with the remaining ingredients, cover the pot, and place over a large saucepan of boiling water. Cook over medium-high heat for 1 to 2 hours.
4. Remove the chicken from the pot, pull off the chicken skin, and discard along with ginger. Skim fat from pan juices. Replace chicken in bowl and serve.
Note: AYunnan pot is a round earthenware pot with a cone in the center that tapers to a small hole at the top, used for seaming food. the same process can be achieved just as easily by using a deep bowl placed on a rack in a deep kettle. If possible, cook the broth with the scallion and ginger for 20 minutes before cooking the recipe. Strain the broth and proceed with the recipe.

1/4 teaspoon pepper 
1/2 cup fine dry Italian style bread crumbs 
1/2 cup tomato sauce 
1 onion, very finely diced 
1 green pepper, very finely diced 
  Cheese Topping (recipe below) 
2 cups mashed potatoes 
1/2 cup finely shredded mild cheddar cheese 
Cheese Topping:   
1 egg 
1/4 cup milk 
1/2 teaspoon salt 
1/2 teaspoon dry mustard 
1/2 teaspoon worcestershire sauce 
1 1/2 cups finely shredded mild cheddar cheese 
Pie Crust:   
1 1/2 cups flour 
1/2 cup shortening 
1/2 teaspoon salt 
7 tablespoons cold water 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Heat oven to 425.

Prepare pastry (directions below).

In skillet, cook and stir ground beef, onion and green peppers until done. Drain fat. Stir in salt, oregano, pepper, crumbs, 1/2 c. tomato sauce. Mix well. Pour into pastry lined pan. Spread Cheese Topping (recipe below) evenly over filling. Then cover with mash potatoes. Sprinkle mash potatoes with 1/2 c. shredded cheese. Cover edge with 2-3&quot; strips of aluminum foil to prevent excessive browning, removing foil for the last 15 minutes of baking. Bake about 30 minutes. Cut into wedges and serve.

Pastry: Mix flour &amp; salt. Cut in shortening until well blended. Add cold water 1 tablespoon at a time. When dough will hold together, roll out on a floured surface. Place in 9&quot; pie pan.

Cheese topping: Mix egg &amp; milk. Add salt, dry mustard and worcestershire sauce. Mix well. Add cheese. Mix well. Pour over meat mixture.

Variations: You can use a bought piecrust if so desired. Also this is a good way to use leftover mash potatoes. We love to make mash potatoes with hot pepper cheese. This would be very good on top of the meat mixture. Just add about 8 oz. of cubed hot pepper cheese in your potatoes when you are mashing them. Just use your imagination.

<Name>Perfect Barbecues</Name>
<Author>http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/</Author>
<Instructions>Charcoal-burning barbecues
1. Setting it up
Place the coals in the barbecueand add solid lighting bricks or fluid in between layers so the barbecue can burn evenly. Once lit, never add flammable liquids. 

2. Perfect heat
Getting the heat right is the next step towards making the perfect barbecue. Wait until the coals have turned grey-white - this can take an hour and shows they’ve burned thoroughly and will radiate a fairly constant heat. 

3. Cooking
Next, place the food on the grill. It shouldn’t burn - charred, black food is caused by coals which aren’t heated properly. Watch fatty foods like burgers and sausages. If fatty foods like these are put over hot coals, the fat will add to the flames making the food inedible. 

4. Cover up
One of the most under-used items in British barbecuing is the cover - using it gives a much smokier taste to your food. Place the cover on and leave the vent open. The barbecue stays warm longer and food is heated more evenly. 

5. Flavour
The addition of dampened bark chips or herbs will add a rich flavour. Be adventurous: small omelette pans and ovenproof dishes can be used to create sumptuous sauces or to cook food that won’t work on an open grill. You’ll be able to serve a much wider range of food this way. 

Gas-powered barbecues 
Advantages of gas
Gas-powered barbecues warm up quickly and heat can be varied according to the food being cooked. Treat the gas barbecue as a portable hob. Any food you can cook on the stove-top will transfer well, including sauces and dishes cooked in pots. Gas barbecues are quicker, easier to clean, more controllable and safer. 

Flavour control
Gas burners come with built-in lids - locking in smoke for flavour. Purists argue gas burners don’t add the same level of flavour as charcoal. Compensate by adding wood chips and keeping the lid closed.

Disposable charcoal barbecues 
Disposable charcoal barbecues are the least controllable barbecue, but are cheap and ideal for occasional feasts. They come with lighting paper and charcoal. They’re easy to start and need minimum maintenance. Unfortunately, they don’t have adjustable vents or lids, and this limits what you can cook. You can buy two sizes: although the larger ones have a larger cooking area, they won’t last as long as kettle-shaped burners. Let the coals become white before cooking; this normally happens within half an hour.

<Name>Sugar snap peas with smoked salmon dip</Name>
<Author>Sandra Watson</Author>
<Ingredients>1/2 lb ( 250 g) smoked salmon  
1 cup ( 250 mL) light or regular sour cream 
1 tbsp ( 15 mL) drained capers 
1 tbsp ( 15 mL) chopped fresh dill 
1-1/2 tsp ( 7 mL) lemon juice 
dash of Tabasco sauce 
1-1/2 lbs ( 750 g) sugar snap peas, snow peas or green beans 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. In a food processor, chop salmon using an on-and-off motion. Add remaining ingredients, except peas, and whirl until almost smooth. Taste and add more lemon juice or Tabasco, if you like. Turn into a serving dish. Use right away or cover and refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour or up to 1 day. 

2. Break off stem ends from sugar snap peas. Half fill a large saucepan with water. Bring to a full rolling boil over high heat. Place a colander in the sink. When water is boiling rapidly, add peas all at once. As soon as they are bright green, after about 30 to 45 seconds, remove from heat. Pour into colander and drain. Rinse with cold water until cool. Drain. Cover and refrigerate until dip is cold or for up to 1 day. Serve dip surrounded by peas for dipping. To pack for a picnic, half fill plastic glasses with cold dip. Stick sugar snap peas upright in dip. Cover with clear wrap.

<Name>Grilled stuffed plum tomatoes</Name>
<Author>http://recipes.chatelaine.com/</Author>
<Ingredients>7 large plum tomatoes 
1 tsp ( 5 mL) olive oil 
1 cup ( 250 mL) crumbled feta  
2 tbsp ( 30 mL) finely chopped fresh mint or basil or basil pesto 
1/4 tsp ( 1 mL) freshly ground black pepper 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Lightly grease grill and preheat barbecue to high. Halve tomatoes lengthwise. Squeeze out juice and seeds. Using a knife, cut out centre pulp from halves, forming tomato shells. Finely chop pulp and place in a bowl. Finely chop 2 tomato halves, then add to bowl. Brush remaining tomato halves all over with oil. Place on grill, cut-side down, over high heat. Barbecue, without turning, until marked on cut side, about 5 minutes. 

2. Meanwhile, stir feta, mint and pepper into tomatoes in bowl. After 5 minutes of grilling, remove tomato halves. Spoon tomato-cheese mixture into hollow of each grilled tomato half, pressing filling gently. Place tomatoes back on grill, filling-side up. Cover and grill until tomatoes are hot, from 4 to 5 minutes. Alternatively, cook tomatoes, bottom-side up, on a greased baking sheet in a 450F (230C) oven for 5 minutes. Turn, add cheese mixture, then broil until cheese is tinged with brown, about 1 minute.

<Ingredients>1/2 tsp ( 2 mL) freshly cracked black pepper 
1 tbsp ( 15 mL) chopped fresh rosemary leaves 
1 roasted red pepper, store-bought or home-made, finely chopped 
1/2 cup ( 125 mL) coarsely chopped pitted green or black olives or a mix 
1 lemon 
8 oz ( 250-g) block feta cheese 
1/4 cup ( 50 mL) olive oil

<Instructions>1. Finely grate lemon peel and squeeze out 2 tablespoons (30 mL) juice. If feta is salty, rinse under cold running water. Slice feta in half so you have 2 slices, each about 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick. Place in a single layer in a glass bowl or container just a little larger than feta. 

2. In a bowl, whisk oil with lemon juice. Pour mixture over feta. Sprinkle with lemon peel, pepper, rosemary, roasted pepper and olives. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least overnight but preferably up to 2 days. Occasionally baste lemon mixture overtop. Remove from refrigerator 1 hour before serving. 

3. To serve, stack feta on a plate, then pour lemon mixture overtop. Great with baguette slices or crackers for spreading cheese.

1/2 cup ( 125 mL) 4 oz pkg herbed chèvre or creamy goat cheese 
2 green onions, thinly sliced </Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. To roast a fresh red pepper, slice in half and remove seeds. Place cut-side down on a piece of foil set on a baking sheet. Roast, uncovered, in a 400F (200C) oven until part of skin is blackened, from 20 to 25 minutes. When cool enough to handle, peel off skin. If using prepared roasted pepper (usually sold in jars in the pickle section of supermarkets), remove enough pieces to fill a 1/2-cup (125-mL) measure when coarsely chopped. Drain well and pat dry. 

2. Place peppers in a blender or food processor. Add cheese and whirl, stopping to scrape down sides several times, until smooth. Stir in green onions. Use right away or refrigerate. 

3. Cheese mixture thickens when chilled and will keep well, covered, for at least 2 days. Use as a spread on thin slices of baguette and top with a sprig of fresh coriander, baby shrimp, a sprig of dill or a fan of snow peas. Or use as a dip with cheese straws, fruit or vegetable slices.

<Name>Grilled leg of lamb with herb &amp; spice crust </Name>
<Author>http://recipes.chatelaine.com/</Author>
<Ingredients>3-1/2 lb ( 1.75-kg) boneless butterflied leg of lamb 
6 garlic cloves 
1 tbsp ( 15 mL) each of coriander seeds and black peppercorns 
2 tsp ( 10 mL) fennel seeds 
3 tbsp ( 45 mL) olive oil 
1 tbsp ( 15 mL) fresh thyme leaves or 1 tsp (5 mL) dried leaf thyme 
1 tbsp ( 15 mL) fresh rosemary leaves, coarsely chopped, or 1 tsp (5 mL) dried crumbled rosemary 
3/4 tsp ( 4 mL) salt 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. To avoid flare-ups, trim as much fat from lamb as possible. For grilling, meat should be of even thickness. If there is a thick portion, slash it and open it up butterfly-style. 

2. Coarsely grind garlic, coriander, pepper and fennel in a spice or coffee grinder. Measure oil into a small bowl. Stir in garlic mixture, thyme, rosemary and salt. Spread over both sides of lamb. Place in a resealable plastic bag or in a dish. Seal bag or cover dish with plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight. 

3. Before grilling, bring lamb to room temperature so meat cooks evenly. Oil grill and preheat barbecue. Grill lamb, loosely covered with foil or with lid down, turning once, until browned, about 10 to 15 minutes per side for medium-rare. Remove to a platter. Let sit, covered, for 10 minutes before thinly slicing lamb across the grain. Lamb is best served right away.

<Ingredients>6 chicken pieces, about 3 lbs (1.5 kg)  
1/3 cup ( 75 mL) frozen orange-juice concentrate, defrosted but undiluted 
2 tbsp ( 30 mL) liquid honey 
2 tbsp ( 30 mL) soy sauce 
1 tsp ( 5 mL) chili powder 
1 crushed garlic clove or (1/4 tsp/1 mL) garlic powder 
1/2 tsp ( 2 mL) cayenne pepper 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Remove chicken skin, if you wish. Stir orange-juice concentrate with honey, soy, chili powder, garlic and cayenne. To precook chicken in the microwave, place bone-side down in a microwave-safe dish. Cover with waxed paper or plastic wrap, venting 1 corner. Microwave on high, turning chicken once, until chicken is just cooked, and it has no pink remaining and feels springy to the touch, about 15 to 30 minutes. If your microwave does not have a turntable, rotate dish a quarter turn every 10 minutes. 

2. Place chicken, bone-side down, on a hot greased barbecue. Grill, brushing often with orange mixture until golden, about 10 minutes per side. Or, to cook chicken entirely on barbecue, place raw chicken, bone-side down, on barbecue over low heat. Grill slowly with lid closed, turning often until almost done, about 40 minutes. Then, brush frequently with orange-juice mixture until glazed and chicken feels springy, about 10 to 20 more minutes. Covered and refrigerated, chicken will keep well for 2 days.

2. Brush sauce over chicken and peppers. Place on grill. Barbecue until underside of chicken is golden, about 8 to 10 minutes. Turn chicken and peppers, then brush with more sauce. Add zucchini, pineapple and oranges to grill. Brush with sauce. Continue cooking until chicken is golden, fruit and zucchini are hot and peppers are tender. This will take about 8 to 10 more minutes. Turn zucchini and fruit at least once. Covered and refrigerated, chicken, vegetables and pineapple will keep well for 1 day. Oranges, however, taste best served the same day they are grilled.

<Instructions>1. To make sauce, heat oil in a large saucepan set over medium heat. Add onions, garlic, chili powder and spices. Cook, stirring often, until onion has softened, about 5 minutes. Squeeze enough juice from lemons to measure 1/4 cup. Stir into onions along with ketchup, brown sugar and Worcester shire. Bring to a boil, stirring often. Reduce heat to low and simmer, uncovered, until thickened, about 15 to 20 minutes. Stir often, especially near end of cooking time. Use right away or cover and refrigerate for up to 1 week. 

2. When ready to barbecue ribs, oil grill and preheat barbecue. Place ribs bone-side down on barbecue and grill, turning at least once, for 30 minutes. Spoon about a third of barbecue sauce into a serving dish to be used as a dipping sauce for ribs and set aside. While ribs are on grill, liberally brush them with remaining sauce. Continue barbecuing, turning and brushing often with sauce, until richly glazed and browned, about 15 to 30 more minutes depending on thickness of meat. As soon as ribs are done as you like, move to a cooler part of grill or remove. Cover to keep warm. Serve piping hot with extra sauce, corn on the cob and a selection of salads.

<Notes>These ribs are decadent, slathered with a lemon-jolted homemade barbecue sauce. Before digging in, tie on a bib and have plenty of serviettes handy. Most supermarkets carry beef ribs, but if yours doesn&apos;t, ask your local butcher to save them for you. They&apos;re generally cheaper than pork ribs. </Notes>

<Ingredients>3 cups ( 750 mL) water 
1-1/2 cups ( 375 mL) long-grain rice, preferably parboiled 
1/2 tsp ( 2 mL) salt 
6 large plum tomatoes or 3 beefsteak tomatoes 
1/2 red onion 
4 green onions 
3 cups ( 750 mL) cooked black beans 
1/3 cup ( 75 mL) vegetable oil 
3 tbsp ( 45 mL) freshly squeezed lime or lemon juice 
1 tbsp ( 15 mL) toasted cumin seed (see tip below) 
1/4 to 1/2 tsp ( 1 to 2 mL) salt 
2 tbsp ( 30 mL) finely chopped pickled jalapeño peppers (see tip below) 
    or hot banana peppers 
1/4 tsp ( 1 mL) cayenne pepper (optional) 
3 cups ( 750 mL) cooked corn kernels 
1/2 cup ( 125 mL) chopped fresh coriander 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Bring water, rice and salt to a boil over high heat. Cover and immediately reduce heat to low. Simmer, without lifting lid, for 15 minutes. Then check rice. If most of water is still not absorbed, cover and cook 5 more minutes. If rice is not al dente and most of water is still not absorbed, continue cooking, covered, for another 5 minutes. Then drain. To quickly cool and dry rice, spread it out on a baking sheet and leave at room temperature. 

2. Meanwhile, seed and coarsely chop tomatoes. You should have about 3 cups (750 mL). Very thinly slice onions. Drain beans and rinse under cold running water. Drain well. In a small bowl, whisk oil with lime juice, cumin seed and salt. Finely chop jalapeños and stir in. For a truly fiery taste, whisk in cayenne as well. 

3. Turn rice into a large mixing bowl. Whisk dressing until blended and pour in. Stir until evenly coated. Then add tomatoes, onions, beans and corn. Gently stir just until mixed. Serve right away or cover and refrigerate for up to 1 day. Stir in or sprinkle with coriander just before serving.

<Author>http://recipes.chatelaine.com</Author>
<Ingredients>8 whole tomatoes, ripe but firm 
1 to 2 tbsp ( 15 to 30 mL) olive oil 
1 head romaine lettuce 
2 whole green onions, thinly sliced 
1/3 cup ( 75 mL) olive oil 
3 tbsp ( 45 mL) balsamic or red wine vinegar 
2 to 3 minced garlic cloves 
1 tsp ( 5 mL) dried leaf oregano 
generous pinches of salt and freshly ground black pepper 
1 cup ( 250 mL) crumbled feta cheese 
    1/4 cup ( 50 mL) finely chopped fresh basil (optional) 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Preheat barbecue and lightly oil grill. Place whole tomatoes on grill. Do not core tomatoes. Brush lightly on all sides with 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 mL) olive oil and turn frequently until tomato skins are lightly charred, from 10 to 12 minutes. Skins will break during barbecuing but tomatoes will not be mushy. 

2. While tomatoes are being barbecued, shred lettuce and place on a serving platter or in a bowl. Evenly sprinkle with sliced green onions. Then, in a small bowl, using a small whisk or fork, whisk 1/3 cup (75 mL) olive oil with vinegar, garlic, oregano, salt and pepper. Set aside and let flavors meld until ready to use. 

3. When tomatoes are hot, remove to a cutting board. Core, then coarsely chop or cut into wedges. Scatter over lettuce. Immediately sprinkle crumbled feta over warm tomatoes. Then drizzle with olive oil mixture. Sprinkle with fresh basil. Toss and serve immediately with thick slices of whole grain bread.

<Ingredients>3/4 cup ( up to 1 cup, 175 to 250 mL) granulated sugar 
1/4 cup ( 50 mL) all-purpose flour 
1/2 tsp ( 2 mL) grated lemon peel 
1/2 tsp ( 2 ml) ground nutmeg 
salt 
5 cups ( 1.25 L) fresh raspberries or blueberries, 
     or 2 (300-g) pkgs frozen unsweetened berries (do not defrost) 
1 Pastry for a 2-crust (9-inch/23-cm) pie 
1 tsp ( 5 mL) lemon juice 
1 tbsp ( 15 mL) butter 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Measure sugar, flour, peel, nutmeg and salt into a large mixing bowl. Stir with a fork until blended. Measure out berries, but do not add to sugar mixture. 

2. Preheat oven to 450F (230C). Using a rolling pin, roll out half of pastry on a lightly floured surface so it is no more than 1/8 inch (0.25 cm) thick. Line a 9-inch (23-cm) pie plate. Do not prick bottom. Roll out top crust. 

3. Just before baking, gently stir fresh or frozen berries into sugar mixture until coated. Turn into pastry-lined pie plate. Sprinkle with lemon juice and dot with little bits of butter. Cover with top crust. Seal and flute edges. Slash top in several places. Place on a baking sheet to catch any drips. Bake on bottom rack of 450F (230C) oven just until pastry edges become golden-tipped, about 10 to 12 minutes. Then, reduce heat to 350F (180C) and continue baking until crust is golden and fruit is bubbly, about 40 to 45 more minutes for fresh berries or up to 60 minutes for frozen berries. Place on a rack to cool before slicing. Pie tastes best the same day it&apos;s baked.

<Author>http://recipes.chatelaine.com/</Author>
<Ingredients>5 cups ( 1.25 L) all-purpose flour 
2/3 cup ( 150 mL) granulated sugar 
2 tbsp ( 30 mL) baking powder 
1-1/2 tsp ( 7 mL) salt 
3/4 cup ( 175 mL) vegetable shortening 
2 cups ( 500 mL) buttermilk or sour milk (see tip, below) 
2 L ( 2 quarts) strawberries or other fresh berries, such as blackberries, raspberries or blueberries 
whipped cream (optional) 
mint for garnish (optional) 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Preheat oven to 375F (190C). (This oven temperature is lower than we usually use for biscuits, but gave the best results.) Measure flour, sugar, baking powder and salt into a large mixing bowl. Stir with a fork until blended. Then, using a pastry blender or two knives, cut shortening into flour mixture until mealy. Make a well in centre and pour in buttermilk or sour milk. Stir just until dry ingredients are moistened. Do not over-mix or biscuits will be tough. 

2. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. If using sour milk, heavily flour surface because dough will be sticky. Using lightly floured hands, form dough into a ball, then flatten top. Fold dough in half using a kneading motion. Turn dough and repeat 3 or 4 times. Then, roll with a rolling pin or pat gently with your hand until about 1-1/2 inches (3.5 cm) thick. Cut out biscuits with a 2-1/2-inch- (6-cm-) wide heart-shaped or round cookie cutter. Gather scraps, gently pat out again to 1-1/2 inch (3.5 cm) thickness and cut additional shapes. If you like a sparkling sugar top, lightly brush each biscuit top with milk. Then, sprinkle with a little additional coarse or granulated sugar. Place on ungreased baking sheets. Immediately bake in centre of 375 F (190 C) oven until lightly golden, about 23 to 25 minutes. Using a spatula, transfer biscuits to a cooling rack. 

3. Meanwhile, wash berries under cold running water and drain. Remove hulls and thickly slice. Split biscuits in half, horizontally, preferably while warm. Fill with berries and a large dab of whipped cream. Garnish with a sprig of mint and additional berries.

<Name>Aunt Dianne&apos;s rhubarb pie </Name>
<Author>http://recipes.chatelaine.com/</Author>
<Ingredients>9 inch ( 23 cm) homemade or purchased deep-dish pie crust 
4 eggs, separated 
1-1/2 cups ( 375 mL) brown sugar 
1/3 cup ( 75 mL) all-purpose flour 
1/4 cup ( 50 mL) melted butter 
5 cups ( 1.25 L) fresh or frozen rhubarb pieces, about 1/2 inch (1 cm) thick 
1 pinch cream of tartar 
1/3 cup ( 75 mL) brown sugar 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Place one oven rack on the lowest level and one just above the centre. Preheat oven to 425 F (220 C). Line pie plate with homemade crust. Or drop purchased crust, still in foil pan, into a glass pie plate. This produces a crisper crust and makes it easier to handle a finished pie. Separate eggs, placing whites in a very clean (even a hint of fat will prevent whites from whipping) medium-size mixing bowl. Set aside while continuing with recipe. 

2. In a large mixing bowl, stir 1-1/2 cups brown sugar with flour. Stir in yolks and butter until blended. Stir in rhubarb. When mixed, turn into pie shell. Smooth top. Bake, uncovered, on lowest oven rack for 10 minutes. Then, without opening oven door, reduce heat to 350F (180C) and continue baking until filling is bubbly and golden-topped like a butter tart, from 45 to 50 minutes. Remove to a cooling rack. 

3. Using an electric mixer, beat egg whites and cream of tartar until soft moist peaks form when beaters are lifted, about 1 minute. While continuing to beat, gradually crumble in 1/3 cup brown sugar. Beat until stiff shiny peaks form when beaters are lifted, about 1 to 2 minutes. Immediately turn mixture onto warm pie filling. Using the back of a large spoon, gently spread meringue so it covers filling and a portion of the pastry to form a seal. Do not press down, but gently swirl surface forming small peaks. Place on centre rack of 350F (180C) oven and bake until meringue is golden-tipped, about 6 minutes. Remove from oven and cool on a rack. Because of the meringue, it&apos;s best to serve as soon as possible, but pie will keep well at room temperature for up to 1 day. For a party, bake filled crust ahead. Just before serving, add meringue and bake.

<Ingredients>    4 cups ( 1 L) vegetable oil for frying 
    1/3 cup ( 75 mL) granulated sugar  
    1 large mango, ripe but firm  
    1 large banana, ripe but firm  
    1/2 cup ( 125 mL) shredded sweetened coconut 
    2 tbsp ( 30 mL) each of granulated and brown sugar 
    generous pinches of ground ginger 
    12 spring roll wrappers 
    1 egg white, lightly beaten 
    dusting of icing sugar 
    1 cup ( 250 mL) mango purée (see below)  
    dollop of coconut or ginger ice cream (optional) 
    2 kiwis, peeled and sliced (optional) 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Pour enough oil into a medium-size deep frying pan to reach at least 2 inches (5 cm) in depth, but no more than one-third up side of pan. Place 1/3 cup (75 mL) granulated sugar in a shallow dish. Line a baking sheet with paper towels. 

2. For 2 different fillings, peel mango and slice fruit from pit. Slice flesh into matchstick-size pieces. Place in a medium-size bowl. Peel banana and slice into matchstick-size pieces. Place in a separate bowl. Add 1/4 cup (50 mL) coconut and 1 tablespoon (15 mL) each of granulated and brown sugar to each filling. Stir ginger into mango filling, tasting and adding a little more, if you like, and cinnamon into banana filling. 

3. Place 6 spring roll wrappers on a counter. Cover remaining with a damp cloth. Dividing mixture equally, spoon mango filling onto 1 top corner of each wrapper. Tightly roll corner toward centre to partially enclose filling. Once you reach centre, fold in sides to cover filling. Continue tightly rolling up wrapper to form a small log. To seal, brush seam with egg white. Repeat with banana filling and remaining wrappers. 

4. To fry rolls, place pan with oil over medium-high heat and heat to 350F (180C). Carefully slip 2 to 3 rolls into hot oil. Don’t overcrowd. Fry, turning once or twice until golden brown, from 2 to 3 minutes. Once browned, immediately remove rolls to paper towel-lined sheet. Blot dry, then immediately roll in granulated sugar until lightly coated. Place on a tray. Repeat with remaining spring rolls. 

5. To serve, slice a warm mango spring roll in half on the diagonal. Place a whole banana spring roll on a dessert plate. Set a half of mango roll on its end beside banana roll. Place other half on banana roll. Sift a little icing sugar overtop. Drizzle mango purée around rolls. Add a scoop of ice cream and a few slices of kiwi, if you like. Repeat with remaining spring rolls. 

6. Mango Purée: Purée pulp of 1 mango in a food processor with 1/4 cup (50 mL) water. Add lime juice or sugar to taste. If too thick, thin with water.

<Ingredients>2 tb Butter 
1 ts Cayenne pepper 
1 c Unsalted chicken stock 
4 Ears yellow corn, shucked, 
Sliced into 1-inch thick 
Wheels 
3 lb Chicken, cut into bite size 
Pieces. 
2 ts Sweet paprika 
1 c Onions finely diced 
3 c Milk 
2 lg Yucca peeled and cut into 
Inch thick dice. 
Juice of one lime. </Ingredients>
<Instructions>Melt the butter in a 6 qt. pot over medium heat. Cook chicken pieces in the butter until no longer pink. Remove chicken with slotted spoon and place in in a bowl. Put onion, garlic, cayenne, and paprika in pot and cook while stirring, until onion is translucent and colored with the paprika. Add stock, milk, yuca, corn, and chicken to the pot. Bring almost to a boil then reduce heat, cover and simmer, stirring every now and then, for about 1 hour, or until yucca is tender. Remove from heat and stir in lime juice. Serve with Cuban or French bread that has been sliced and broiled until golden. 

As an alternative frozen corn on the cob will work, as well as fresh frozen kernels. The fresh corn cob seems to impart a nice flavor to this dish. 
If you&apos;re wondering what to do with the wheels of corn, just pick &apos;em up with your fingers and nibble &apos;round the rims. </Instructions>

<Notes>This recipe is for a Cuban stew/soup that I used to enjoy con mucho gusto. This version of Ajiaco was prepared by Senora Garcia in her little store front restaurant on Collins Ave. in Miami Beach.

<Name>Anchor Bar Hot Wings</Name>
<Author>G.SCHAEFFER</Author>
<Ingredients>Chicken wings 
Read below </Ingredients>
<Instructions> Wash the wings in cold water, split them at the joint and remove the tips. Place them on a rack on a pan and refrigerate overnight to let the blood and water drain out of the wings. THIS IS A REAL KEY. Drying the wings under refrigeration will help to make them a much crispier product, once deep fried. Next, use a deep fryer or a very heavy deep pot with a thermometer and add the oil. Peanut oil is very good, or a commercial product such as can be found at a restaurant cash and carry called Mel Fry. Heat the oil up SLOWLY, to 365F, and depending on the size of the fryer, deep fry the dry wings 6-8 minutes in small batches, until thoroughly done and golden brown. Hold the cooked wings in a warm oven if necessary. A combination of melted margarine and hot sauce in the ratio of 1 part margarine to 3 parts hot sauce will add the right zing. The key here is to add just enough sauce to coat the wings - the more sauce you add, the hotter they will be. For the very brave, 1 part margarine to 3 parts hot sauce and 1 part Tabasco is referred to as &quot;Suicidal Wings&quot; by the late and dear Don Bellissimo, who owned the Anchor Bar. Working quickly, place the deep fried wings in a large bowl and add the sauce mixture, shaking to coat them. There are many good hot sauces to use; the one they use is either Durkee Franks Red Hot Sauce or Wingers Original, again found in a restaurant cash and carry. Celery sticks and chunky blue cheese dressing (Ken&apos;s Buffalo Style Blue Cheese is a popular one) and plenty of napkins. 
</Instructions>
<Serves>12</Serves>
<Notes>The key to good Buffalo Wings is how you prepare them as well as the ingredients and the handling of the wings. The most successful wings served up here in Buffalo are what they call &quot;Grade A Grinders.&quot; Fresh wings that are very large and meaty. Usually, you cannot get them in a frozen package, but can get them from a poultry dealer. Once you find them make sure they are absolutely fresh</Notes>

<Name>Anginares Me Anitho - Artichokes with Dill</Name>
<Author>The Complete Middle East Cookbook&quot; by Tess Mallos</Author>
<Ingredients>Karen Mintzias 
12 md Globe artichokes 
1 Lemon (juice only) 
Lemon slices 
3 tb Flour (optional) 
1/2 c Chopped scallinos,white only 
1/4 c Olive or other oil 
1 Lemon (juice only) 
3 c Water 
Salt 
Freshly ground white pepper 
2 tb Finely chopped dill 
3 ts Cornflour 
Cold water 
2 Eggs 
Chopped dill for garnish </Ingredients>
<Instructions>Serves: 4 as a light meal, 8 as a first course Cooking time: 45-50 minutes 
Wash artichokes well and cut off stem close to base. Have ready a bowl of cold water with the juice of 1 lemon and some lemon slices added. If desired stir in 2-3 tablespoons flour as this is quite effective in preventing discoloration. 
As each artichoke is prepared, rub cut surfaces with a lemon slice from the bowl and place in bowl until all are prepared. Cook as soon as possible after preparation. 
Remove 3 or 4 layers of leaves until the tender inner leaves remain. Scoop out choke and pink thorny leaves from centre, using a spoon or melon ball scoop. Cut in half. 
In a large pan gently fry spring onion in oil until soft. Add juice of 1/2 lemon, water, about 2 teaspoons salt and a good grinding of pepper. Bring to the boil. 
Drain prepared artichokes and add to pan with dill. Return to a slow simmer, cover and simmer gently for 30 minutes or until artichokes are tender. Stain cooking liquid into a pan and boil until reduced to half original quantity (about 1-1/2 cups). Keep artichokes hot in a slow oven. 
Mix cornflour to a paste with a little cold water and stir into simmering liquid. Stir until thickened and bubbling and leave to simmer gently. 
Beat eggs in a mixing bowl until light and frothy and gradually add remaining lemon juice. Gradually pour in simmering stock, beating constantly. Return to pan and stir over low heat for a minute or 2 to cook the egg. 
Pile artichokes on a warm platter, pour sauce on top and sprinkle with chopped dill. Serve as a light meal or as a first course.

<Name>Anginares Tarama</Name>
<Author>Recipes from a Greek Island - by Susie Jacobs</Author>
<Ingredients>6 sm Fresh globe artichokes 
1 1/2 oz Tarama; rinsed if necessary =OR=- 
2 oz -Smoked skinned cod&apos;s roe 
1 tb Finely grated onion pulp 
2 lg Juicy lemons 
1 c Fruity olive oil 
Salt 
Freshly ground white pepper </Ingredients>
<Instructions>To clean the artichokes, cut off the stems flush with the base, remove any tough, unsightly outer leaves and cut off the top one-third of the flower bud itself. Force the leaves open a little, and rinse under cold water, with a squeeze of lemon or a splash of vinegar to prevent discoloring. 
Place the artichokes upside-down in a pot large enough to hold them all in one layer and pour in boiling water to come one-fourth of the way up the sides. Salt and simmer 15-40 minutes, depending on their age and size - until the heart is just tender when pricked with a fork. Drain and refresh them under cold water; drain again and chill. 
Beat the tarama or smoked cod&apos;s roe with the grated onion. You can do this easily in a food processor. Finely grate the zest of one lemon and beat in, with 2 teaspoons boiling water. 
Squeeze the juice of both lemons. Alternately dribble in lemon juice and olive oil, beating each addition in before adding the next, as though making mayonnaise - it may not need all the oil. If you are doing this by hand, it take perseverence and elbow grease to make it nice and light. Taste and season with pepper. Open the artichokes and remove the inner, soft leaves and then the hairy choke. Spoon tarama into the cup of leaves.

<Name>Turkish Chicken with Walnut Sauce</Name>
<Author>Philippa Davenport</Author>
<Ingredients>1 3-1/2 to 4 lb chicken 

POACHING FLAVOURINGS: 
2 Onions; sliced, unpeeled 
1 Bouquet garni 
1/2 Lemon (juice only) 
A few peppercorns 
Coriander seeds 

WALNUT SAUCE: 
6 oz Walnut kernels 
1 1/2 oz Crustless bread 
1 1/2 ts Well-toasted corinader seeds 
1 bn Fresh coriander 
2 tb Walnut oil 
1 tb Paprika 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Put the bird into a pan, add the flavourings and enough hot (not boiling) water to cover the thighs. Poach for 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hours until tender. Let the bird cool in the pan, then skin and bone it. Wrap the flesh to keep it succulent. Return the chicken skin and bones to the pan and simmer for 2 hours more. Strain and de-grease. Reduce to 3/4 pints and cool. 
Scald or lightly toast the nuts and rub off the papery thin skins. Then, using a spice or coffee mill, reduce the nuts and coriander seeds to a fine powder. Process in small batches, adding the bread to minumise stickiness. Transfer the aromatic powder to a bowl and gradually blend in as much of the stock as is needed to make a creamy-textured masking sauce ~ you probably won&apos;t need it at all. 
Cut the meat into small strips. Put them into a pretty dish, adding some of the sauce and a little fresh chopped coriander between layers. Spoon the rest of the sauce over the top to cover the meat completely. Just before serving, stir ther walnut oil into the paprika. Drizzle the mixture over the dish in a decorative red pattern and place a little bouquet of fresh coriander in the centre. Serve with rice and a green salad. </Instructions>

<Name>Curried Frogs&apos; Legs - Ech Nau Ca-Ri</Name>
<Author>The Foods of Vietnam&quot; by Nicole Rauthier. Stewart</Author>
<Ingredients>4 Pairs of jumbo frog&apos;s legs 
1 Stalk fresh lemon grass, or 
1 tb Dried lemon grass 
2 Fresh red chilies, seeded and sliced 
2 Shallots, sliced 
2 Garlic cloves, crushed 
1 1/2 ts Sugar 
1 ts Curry paste 
2 ts Curry powder 
1/4 ts Salt 
2 tb Nuoc mam (fish sauce) 
2 oz Cellophane noodles 
2 tb Vegetable oil 
1 sm Onion, chopped 
1 c Chicken broth or water 
1/2 c Coconut milk or heavy cream 
1 ts Cornstarch 
Fresh ground black pepper 
Coriander sprigs for garnish </Ingredients>
<Instructions>This delicious lemon grass and coconut-laced curry comes from southern Vietnam. If you prefer a very hot curry, simply use more chile peppers. 
Cut the frogs&apos; legs into bite-size pieces. Rinse with cold water to remove any chipped bones. Pat dry and refrigerate. 
If you are using fresh lemon grass, discard the outer leaves and upper half of the stalk. Cut into thin slices and finely chop. If you are using dried lemon grass, soak it in warm water for 1 hour. Drain and finely chop. 
In a blender, combine the lemon grass with the chiles, shallots, garlic, sugar, curry paste, curry powder, salt and 1 tablespoon of the fish sauce. Process to a very fine paste. Rub the paste over the frogs&apos; legs. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes. 
Meanwhile, soak the cellophane noodles in warm water for 30 minutes. Drain. Cut into 2-inch sections. 
Heat the oil in a saucepan over moderate heat. Add the onion and saute until translucent. Add the frogs&apos; legs and brown well on all sides, about 3 minutes. Add the chicken broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover and simmer for 15 minutes. 
Uncover the pan and add the coconut milk, the cornstarch diluted in 1 tablespoon of cold water and the remaining 1 table- spoon fish sauce. Cook, stirring, until the sauce thickens, about 15 minutes. 
Add the cellophane noodles and bring the mixture to a boil. Remove from the heat. 
Sprinkle with black pepper and garnish with coriander sprigs. 
Serve immediately with rice, French bread or over rice noodles. 
Note: Instead of discarding the upper half of the lemon grass, crush it and cook it with the frogs&apos; legs for extra flavor. Remove the stalk before serving.

<Ingredients>2 tb Sweetened Condensed Milk 
6 oz Strong Black Coffee </Ingredients>
<Instructions>In restaurants and cafe, dark-roast coffee is brewed in an individual drip pot that sits on top of a glass, slowly dripping into sweet milk. it takes a good 10 to 15 minutes for the water to finish dripping through, and the coffee is sipped at an equally leisurely pace. Both the coffee and the pots are available in Southeast Asian markets, but any type of coffee and any brew- method that produces a strong, rich-tasting cup will do. 
Place the milk in the bottom of an 8 ounce glass. Carefully pour in coffee, trying not to disturb the layer of milk. Stir milk up from bottom and sip coffee. There will probably be some milk left in the bottom of the glass when you are finished. 
Makes 1 serving.

<Instructions>Grind peanuts. Heat oil in a frying pan, add pork, garlic and onions. Cook until pink color disappears. Drain off most of the fat. Add sugar and pepper, cook 1-2 minutes. Add peanuts, mix in well, then remove from heat. Cool to room temperature. 
Prepare platter, lining with lettuce leaves. Peel and segment the citrus fruit if used, cutting each segment down to the back and fanning open to form a circle. If using pineapple, cut off top leaves and outer skin, as thinly as possible, from top down. Look at the &quot;eye&quot; pattern, as it forms a spiral down the pineapple. Cut the spirals with a sharp knife held at about a 45 degree angle. Cut off bottom. Cut pineapple into about 5 or 6 wedges and then cut each of those into 1/4 inch slices. Arrange fruit on platter. 
Mound meat mixture onto fruit, and decorate with other garnishes. Serve at room temperature, or chilled. </Instructions>

<Ingredients>1 lb Fresh green beans 
2 tb Thai Curry Paste 
2 tb Vegetable oil 
Bamboo shoots (optional) 
6 c Chicken broth </Ingredients>
<Instructions>Clean and pick green bean tips. In a dutch oven (or equivalent size vessel), heat oil. Add curry paste and &quot;fry&quot; until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add broth, green beans, bamboo shoots (or other vegetable). Bring to a rapid boil and cook like that for about 15-20 minutes (watching that liquid doesn&apos;t reduce too much; add water as necessary). Reduce heat to a hard simmer and continue cooking until green beans are VERY done and have absorbed the flavor of the curry broth. Serve in bowls over rice. 
NOTES: If necessary, you may substitute whole frozen green beans for fresh. 
Thai Curry Paste: &quot;Country Curry&quot; or &quot;Red Curry&quot;; but they are all flavorful. Mae Ploy and Tommy Tang are other good brands. 
Bamboo shoots: I like to use a large can of bamboo tips because they are tender and I can cut them into 1/4 inch thick round slices. You can also use a couple of the small cans of sliced bamboo shoots, but they will not absorb the flavor as well. I think carrots cut into coins would also be good, if you like those. I tried potatoes once, but they just disintegrated.)

6 oz Med shrimp shelled and deveined 
1 Whole boned chicken breast cut into slices 
4 Shallots; minced 
1 tb Minced garlic 
2 sm Serrano chiles finely minced 
1 Lime (zest only)

3 tb Fresh coriander leaves 
1/2 lb Bean sprouts; tails removed (for garnish) 

CRISPY EGG LACE: 
Oil for deep-frying 
2 Eggs; lightly beaten 
1/4 ts Salt 

</Ingredients>
<Instructions>COVER TAMARIND WITH 3/4 CUP hot water. Crush and break up pulp with a fork and let it stand for 20 minutes. Pour mixture through a strainer and press it through. Collect 1/2 cup tamarind liquid. Pour oil into a wok or deep saucepan to a depth of about 2-inches. Heat oil to 375F. In a large paper bag pull rice stick noodles apart into small batches. Add 1 batch to the oil. If the temperature is correct, noodles should puff up within seconds. Remove with a slotted spoon or strainer and drain on paper towel. Repeat with remaining noodles. If you are making the Crispy Egg Lace, prepare it at this time (See below). When the rice stick noodles and egg lace are done, pour off all but 2 tablespoons of oil from wok. Reheat wok and oil over medium-high heat. When hot, add shrimp and chicken; stir-fry for 1 minute or until shrimp are bright orange and chicken is white. Remove and set aside. Add shallots, garlic, minced chiles and half the lime zest to the hot wok; stir-fry until soft, but not browned (about 1 minute). Add tomato paste and sugar. Cook, stirring constantly, until sugar becomes a dark crimson red with a sticky consistency. It should pull away from the wok into a thick mass. This is just short of the caramelized state (about 3 to 4 minutes). Be careful not to burn the mixture. Immediately add the reserved tamarind liquid and fish sauce, reduce to low heat and simmer together for 1 minute. Add lime juice, reserved chicken-shrimp mixture, green onion and remaining lime zest; toss just enough to heat through. Remove from heat. Add 1/3 of fried rice stick noodles to the sauce. Gently crush noodles and toss with sauce to coat. Repeat with another third of noodles. Add last third of noodles only if there is enough sauce to coat. Toss in the coriander leaves. Mound noodles on a platter, Crispy Egg Lace (broken into smaller pieces) and bean sprouts. 

CRISPY EGG LACE: After frying noodles, skim leftover bits from wok. Keep oil hot. Beat eggs with salt in bowl. When oil is 375F, hold a medium-fine-mesh skimmer over oil; gently pour half the eggs through. Let eggs drip into oil in circular fashion. Deep-fry for 30 seconds or until lightly brown and crisp. Turn over to brown. It should have an irregular lacy shape. Remove and drain on paper towels. Keep in a warm oven. Break into smaller pieces. Makes 2 crispy egg laces. </Instructions>

<Name>Mee Krob (Sweet Thai Noodles)</Name>
<Author>Thai Home-Cooking</Author>
<Ingredients>1/4 c Water 
1 c Sugar (white granulated) 
1 c Vinegar (white) 
1 ts Salt 
1/4 lb Dried shrimp (Kung Haeng) 
8 ea Serrano chilies 
1 bn Green onions (whites only) 
8 oz Tofu, firm or extra firm 
3 ea Eggs 
2 c Vegetable oil (approx. amnt) 
1/4 lb Rice noodles (very thin) </Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Combine the water, sugar, vinegar, and salt in a small saucepan. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil and cook about ten minutes, until it forms a thin syrup. Set aside. 
2. Put the dried shrimp in a sieve and rinse them thoroughly under running water. Set them aside in the sieve to drain. Remove the stems, but not the seeds, from the chilies. Slice the green onions and chilies lengthwise into thin strips and set them aside together. 
3. Slice the tofu into 1/4-inch cubes and set aside. Beat the eggs lightly, until they are well mixed but not frothy. Strain through a fine sieve and set aside. 
4. Pour about three inches of oil in a wok and heat it to 400 degrees F. Dry the tofu with paper towels and deep fry it until the cubes are firm and light golden, but not dry and hard. Remove them from the oil and set aside to drain on paper towels. 
5. Using the same oil, deep fry the noodles a handful at a time. The noodles will puff up immediately and begin to turn brown in about ten seconds. (Note: these are the same type of noodles that are used to make chinese chicken salad.) Be careful not to let them burn. They should be light golden and very puffy. If they do not expand immediately upon touching the oil, the oil is not hot enough. If they turn dark immediately, the oil is too hot. Scoop the noodles out to drain on paper towels. Remove about half the oil from the wok and save it for another use. 
6. Dribble the beaten, sieved eggs over the surface of the hot oil in the wok, to form narrow strands: holding the bowl of eggs in one hand, dip the other into the eggs, stretch it out about 12 inches over the oil, and let the egg run in a thin, steady stream from your fingertips while moving your hand in a circular motion so the surface of the oil is covered wit a thin net of egg. You will need to repeat this procedure about four times. The intent is to create a thin net of egg strands that will cook quickly without massing together. When the strands are set completely and light golden on the bottom, flip them over carefully and brown the other side. Remove from the oil and drain on paper towels. 
7. Dry the shrimp thoroughly with paper towels. Using the same oil, deep fry the shrimp until they are just crisp and light golden, about three minutes. Be prepared for the very strong smell they produce as they fry, but don&apos;t be concerned, since the shrimp will taste nothing like they smell. (You may wish to do this well in advance of the time your guests will arrive and set the shrimp aside to drain on paper towels.) They will form a great deal of foam while they are frying, and it will be necessary to use a strainer to lift them up occasionally to see how well they are cooking. Do not over cook them or let them get dry or hard! Remove them from the oil and drain on paper towels. Discard the remaining oil. 
8. Clean the wok thoroughly and place half the sugar syrup from step 1 in it. Heat the syrup almost to boiling, but do not let it boil. Add half the noodles, half the egg nets (see the variation below), half the tofu, and half the shrimp. Mix gently until the syrup is absorbed, being careful to break the noodles as little as possible. Remove the mixture from the wok and place it on a serving platter. Repeat this step with the rest of the syrup, noodles, eggs, and shrimp. 
9. Garnish the Mee Krob with the green onion whites and chilies. Serve immediately or hold it at room temperature for up to two hours. 
VARIATION: If the eggs have formed attractive nets (you should be so lucky!), you may drape them over the Mee Krob as a garnish rather than adding them in step 8. </Instructions>

Head a wok or large skillet and add about 2 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil. Fry the Serrano peppers about 30 seconds, then add the garlic and stir-fry until it is soft. Add the chicken or pork and stir-fry until the chicken is almost opaque throughout or the pork is browned. Stir in the shrimp and the sauce and mix completely. Make a well in the center of the mixture and pour in the eggs. When they are almost set, scramble them evenly. Add half the noodles, throughly incorporating them into the mixture; stir in the remaining noodles and half the bean sprouts. Cook just until the bean sprouts are nearly wilted. 
Heap the meat and noodles onto a platter. Cover one half of them with ground peanuts and the other half with uncooked bean sprouts. Ring the noodles with lime wedges, cherry tomatoes, and mint sprigs and garnish the top with the fried basil.

<Name>Nue Gra Pao: Stir-Fried Beef with Mint</Name>
<Author>Thai Home-Cooking from Kamolmal&apos;s Kitchen</Author>
<Ingredients>1 lb Flank steak 
14 Serrano chilies finely chopped 
1/4 c Finely chopped garlic 
1/2 c Finely chopped yellow onion 

1/4 c Vegetable oil; PLUS: 
2 tb Vegetable oil 
3 tb Fish sauce 
1 tb Granulated sugar 
1/2 c Water (more if needed) 
1/2 c Mint or basil leaves (loosely packed) 
Green lettuce leaves </Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Slice the beef across the grain into strips 1/4 inch thick and 2 to 3 inches long. Set aside. 
2. Pound or grind the chilies, garlic, and onion to a coarse paste in a mortar or blender. If you use a blender you may need to add the oil to aid in grinding. 
3. Heat a wok, add the oil, and swirl it over the surface of the pan. (Do not add more oil if you have ground the chilies, onion, and garlic in oil.) Add the paste from Step 2 and stir-fry until it is light golden. 
4. Add the beef and stir-fry until it is a uniform tan color, but do not overcook it. 
5. Add the fish sauce, sugar, water, and mint (or basil) leaves. More water may be added if the sauce is too dry. There should be about 1/2 to 3/4 cup sauce, depending on how much water you added. 
Ahead of time note: The dish may be prepared a day in advance to this point. To do so, proceed through Step 5, omitting the mint or basil leaves. When you are ready to serve, heat the mixture and add the leaves. If the meat has absorbed the liquid, add just enough warm water to bring it back to the original consistency. 
6. Arrange a single layer of lettuce leaves in a serving bowl and put the beef mixture over them. Serve the beef immediately or keep it warm while preparing other dishes. 
7. Serve with rice. </Instructions>
<Serves>4</Serves>
<Notes>This is a rich, hearty dish with plenty of typical Thai flavors. Any kind of beef may be used, but flank steak works particularly well because it is easy to cut it across the grain, which helps keep the meat from falling apart during stir-frying and produces a tender result. Be sure to serve plenty of rice, because it helps moderate the hot chilies without detracting from the flavor. You may reduce the number of chilies by up to one half, but traditionally this dish should have a rich, hot chili flavor. </Notes>

<Author>Thai Home-Cooking from Kamolmal&apos;s Kitchen</Author>
<Ingredients>3 Serrano chilies 
1/4 c White vinegar 
1 1/2 lb Flank steak 
1/4 lb Red onion; sliced 
4 Green onions 

1/4 c Lime juice; PLUS: 
1 tb Lime juice 
2 tb Fish sauce 
1 ts Ground roasted chilies * 
2 tb Ground toasted rice ** 
Red lettuce leaves 
Coriander sprigs 
Mint or Basil leaves </Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Remove the stems, but not the seedes, from the chilies. Slice the chiles crosswise into pieces 1/8&quot; thick. Place the sliced chiles and vinegar in a small serving bowl. Let it stand for at least 15 minutes. 
2. Grill the beef to the desired doneness, preferably over charcoal. Slice it across the grain into strips 1/8&quot; thick and 1 to 2 inches long. Put these in a large ceramic bowl. 
3. Peel the red onion, remove the root portion, and slice the onion vertically into thin strips. Slice the green onion diagonally into thin pieces. Add both types of onion to the beef. 
4. Add the lime juice, fish sauce, ground chilies, and ground rice. Mix well 
5. Arrange a single layer of lettuce leaves on a serving platter, and place th beef mixture on top. Garnish with sprigs of coriander and mint or basil leaves. 
6. Serve at room temperature, the vinegar sauce (from Step 1) and rice. 

* Use small hot chilies about 3 to 4 inches long. Roast whole chillie stems and all, in a dry wok or skillet until the color changes to dark red or brown depending on the chilies used. Be careful not to let them burn. When the chilies have cooled, remove the stems and seeds. Place the chilies in a food processor or blender and grind using short pulses. Pre-ground chilies are also commercially available, but often lack the &quot;bite&quot; of home ground ones and may be more expensive. 

** Place uncooked rice in a dry wok or skillet and heat over moderate heat until deep golden brown,s tirring frequently to keep from burning and to allow it to develop a uniform color. Watch the rice carefully after it begins to change colorand stir constantly because it can burn easily at this stage. When it is auniform deep golden color, remove from heat and allow to cool to room temperature. Grind it to a fine powder in a blender or a spice grinder. This can be made in advance and kept in quantity so that there is always a supply on hand, but it is also easy to make up while preparing the dish</Instructions>

<Ingredients>1/2 lb Dried rice noodles 1/8&quot; wide Warm Water 
1/2 lb Shrimp, chicken or pork OR- a combination 
1/4 c Fish sauce 

1/4 c Granulated sugar; plus: 
2 tb Granulated sugar 

1/4 c White vinegar; plus: 
2 tb White vinegar 
1 ts Paprika 
4 Green onions 
1/2 c Vegetable oil (more if needed) 
1 ts Chopped garlic 
2 Eggs 
3/4 lb Bean sprouts 
Ground roasted chiles (see note at end) 
Unsalted roasted peanuts ground 
Lime wedges 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Soak noodles for 20-25 minutes in enough warm water to cover them. They should be flexible and soft, but not so soft that they can be mashed easily with the fingers. Later cooking in liquid will soften them more. Drain them throughly in a colander while preparing the other ingredients. Traditionally they are left in full-length strands, but you may cut them into 8 inch lengths if you find it easier to stir-fry then that way. 
2. Peel and devein the shrimp leaving the tails intact(or remove if preferred) Slice chicken, pork into 1/8 inch strips 1-2 inches long. 
3. Mix the fish sauce, sugar, vinegar, and paprika in a bowl and stir until the sugar dissolves. Set aside. Slice green onions both the green and white parts, diagonally into 1-1/2 inch long pieces. Set aside. 
4. Heat a wok, add the oil and swirl over the surface. Add the garlic and stir fry until light golden. Add the meat and stir-fry until shrimp is pink. If using chicken or pork stir-fry until pink disappears. Add the noodles and toss lightly to coat with oil and the distribute meat and garlic( I often do this in a larger pot since things tend to come out of the wok). 
5. Add the liquid from step 3 and bring it to a boil rapidly, gently folding the noodles without breaking them. Reduce heat to medium and boil the mixture, folding frequently until the noodles have absorbed the liquid (I find a pasta server works great for this step). 
6. Lift the noodles gently from one side of the wok. Pour a little oil along the side of the wok, then break the egg ad slip it into the oil. Break the yolk and cover the egg with the noodles immediately. Repeat this on the opposite side with the other egg. Allow eggs to cook undisturbed, over moderate heat until they are set and almost dry. Additional oil may by added if the eggs or the noodles begin to stick to the wok. 
7. When the eggs are set and almost dry, fold them gently but rapidly into the noodles. Try not to break the noodles, which will be soft and fragile at this point. An effective way is to insert the scoop under the eggs, lift it through, and fold the mixtureover. Continue the lifting and folding motion until the eggs are broken up and well distributed. 
8. Add the green onions (and bean sprouts if you prefer them mixed in) and toss the entire mixture quickly and gently, stll avoiding breaking the noodles. Cook for about 2 minutes or until onions are tender. 
9. Take a large platter spread with bean sprouts(if you left them out above). Spread Pud Thai from wok over top. Sprinkle ground chilies(see note) and ground peanuts over the top and squeeze lime over the top. Or serve toppings seperatly for each diner to add according to taste. 
</Instructions>
<Serves>0</Serves>
<Notes>Note on chilies: Buy whole dried chiles and grind since pre-ground often lack the &quot;bite&quot; of whole ones. Thai chilies may be used (_VERY_ hot), or milder American chiles may be used. The Thai chilies are know as Prig hang. They may also be found in Mexican food sections under the name &quot;Chiles Arbol&quot;. Use sparing if you aren&apos;t used to them they are quite potent.</Notes>

<Ingredients>1/4 c Thai fish sauce 

1/4 c White vinegar; plus: 
2 tb White vinegar 
4 tb Sugar (less if desired) 
1 ts Paprika 
8 oz Thai rice noodles - (about 1/4&quot; thick) 
8 oz Tofu 
2 tb Dried shrimp (optional) 
3 tb Oil 
2 Garlic cloves (or more) 
2 Eggs 
3/4 lb Bean sprouts 
3 Green onions sliced on the diagonal, including white part 
3/4 c Ground peanuts 
1 tb Roasted red chili peppers * 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>* (Take some dried red chili peppers and cook them in an ungreased wok over low stirring constantly until they start to brown. Grind in a coffee grinder or spice mill.) 

Combine first four ingredients and let sit until sugar dissolves. Soak rice noodles/sticks in warm water until they are soft but don&apos;t disintegrate when pressed, about 40 minutes. Drain. Drain tofu by wrapping it in a clean towel and pressing with a large can of tomatoes, about 30 minutes. Cut into 1/4 inch cubes. Rinse dried shrimp in water and drain. 
Put oil in wok, heat to medium, put in crushed garlic. Swirl around for about a minute. Add noodles and mix around for a minute or two. 
Add the tofu and shrimp then immediately add the liquid. Keep stirring until the liquid has all been absorbed into the noodles, about a couple of minutes. 
Lower heat to low or medium-low. Push some of the stuff aside at one end of wok, and break an egg in. Immediately cover with noodles. Do the same at the other end of wok. Let the eggs cook *undisturbed* until the yolks are practically cooked, about three minutes. (*Carefully* peak if unsure.) Slip a slotted spoon under each egg in turn, and bring upward, through the noodles, shaking as you go. The idea is to break up the cooked egg into the rest of the mixture into tiny bits. 
Mix in sprouts and green onions. Let cook for another two minutes. Turn off heat. Add crushed peanuts and enough roasted red chilies to your desired hotness. </Instructions>

1 tb Small dried shrimp (optional) 
1 Inch cubes fried tofu, cut into 1/2-inch slices (optional) 
Big pinch chile flakes 
2 Handfuls bean sprouts, tailed 
2 To 4 tablespoons chicken broth or water, as needed 
4 Green onions, trimmed, cut into 2-inch lengths 

GARNISHES: 
2 tb Coarsely chopped roasted peanuts 
Chile flakes 
2 tb Coarsely chopped fresh coriander leaves 
2 Limes, cut into wedges </Ingredients>
<Instructions>Place noodles in a bowl and cover with warm water; let soak about 15 minutes, or until soft and pliable. Drain; set aside. 
Set a wok over medium-high heat. When hot, add 2 tablespoons of the oil. Add shrimp and chicken; stir-fry until shrimp turns bright orange and chicken turns white, about 30 seconds. Set aside. 
Reheat wok over medium heat. Add the remaining oil and the garlic; brown gently (about 20 seconds). Increase heat to medium- high. Add the bean sauce, tomato paste, fish sauce, vinegar and sugar; stir until sugar dissolves. 
Increase heat to high. Break 1 of the eggs into the sauce; beat 3 or 4 times. Let cook until egg is slightly set but still moist, about 20 seconds. Repeat with second and third egg. There should be tiny flecks of egg peeking through. 
Add the optional radish, dried shrimp and tofu, the chile flakes, softened noodles and 1 handful of bean sprouts to the hot wok. Toss and lift noodles until tender and no longer stiff, about 3 or 4 minutes. 
Add the chicken broth 2 tablespoons at a time if noodles seem dry, the green onions and the reserved shrimp/chicken mixture; toss for 30 seconds to reheat. The sauce is not a wet sauce; it should &quot;dry-coat&quot; the noodles. 
Transfer to a platter and serve with a sprinkling of chopped peanuts, chile flakes to taste and fresh coriander leaves. Arrange. remaining bean sprouts and lime wedges around noodles. (Squeeze lime over noodles before eating.) Serve warm or at room temperature. 
Note: Traditionally, Pad Thai uses dried, flat Y4-inch-wide fettuccine-like rice-flour noodles, labeled &quot;Chantaboon rice sticks.&quot;

<Ingredients>8 oz Small size rice noodles 
3 tb Tomato sauce OR- tamarind paste 
2 tb Vegetable oil

3 tb Fish sauce 
1/2 lb Shrimp, cleaned and shelled 
1 Handful bean sprouts (fresh) - chopped once or twice 
2 oz Green onions - cut into 1/2 inch pieces 
2 tb Finely chopped peanuts </Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Soak the rice noodles in cold tap water about 20 minutes, until they are &quot;springy&quot;. Then drain in a colander until needed. 
2. If using dried tamarind, soak the tamarind in hot water for awhile, then mash with a fork to soften. Force as much of the mixture as you can through a seive to remove bits of bark, etc. 
3. Heat oil in wok, and add the tamarind/tomato sauce, picked radish, and sugar. Mix well and let heat up. 
4. Add the noodles, small portions at a time, and and that water/stock. Mix well until all the noodles are coated with the mixture. Add more liquid if necessary -- it will cook out. Don&apos;t be easy on the noodles ~- chop them with the spatula or spoon some to separate them. It may help to &quot;toss&quot; the noodles like a salad, to get them coated. 
5. Beat the egg and mix with the noodles. Add the fish sauce and shrimp. Mix everything thoroughly. The noodles will tend to &quot;clump&quot;, so stir or &quot;toss&quot; like a salad to get everything mixed, and to ensure that the egg and shrimp cook thoroughly. It will help to cover the wok with a lid for a minute or so, then toss the mixture, then cover again. You&apos;ll know it&apos;s done when the shrimp are completely pink. There may be a little browning of the noodles; stirring will keep them from burning.

<Ingredients>1/4 lb Dried rice stick noodles 
2 tb Vegetable oil 
1 tb Coarsely chopped garlic 
8 Shrimps, peeled and deveined 
1 Egg; lightly beaten 
1 tb Fish sauce 
2 ts Sugar 
2 tb Coarsely chopped peanuts - (dry-roasted type) 
1 c Bean sprouts 
4 Slender green onions - sliced in 1 inch lengths 
1 Lime; quartered lengthwise </Ingredients>
<Instructions>Paht Thai is a noodle dish almost everyone seems to like. A tangle of slender rice noodles is sauteed with garlic, shallots, and an orchestra of sweet, sour, and salty ingredients that play a piquant symphony of Thai flavors. A handful of fresh bean sprouts provides a cooling contrast to the hot, seasoned noodles, and circles of lime invite you to bring sourness to center stage as you begin to eat. 
Traditional ingredients are salty dried shrimp; crispy pieces of fried, pressed bean curd; sweet-sour nuggets of pickled white radish; chopped peanuts; flat, green garlic chives; and a balanced chorus -- sweet, sour, salty, hot -- of palm sugar, tamarind, vinegar, lime, brown bean sauce, and crushed dried red chilies. 
Thai cooks blithely tinker with the classic formula to create signature versions, and you can, too. Siriluk Williams, owner of Sukothai Restaurant in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, gave me her recipe for  

Soak rice noodles in warm water to cover for 15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare all the remaining ingredients and place them next to the stove, along with a small serving platter. When the noodles are very limp and white, drain and measure out 2 1/2 cups. Set these by the stove as well. 
Heat a wok or large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of the oil and swirl to coat the surface. When the oil is very hot, drop a piece of the garlic into the pan. If it sizzles immediately, the oil is ready. Add the garlic and toss until golden, about 30 seconds. Add the shrimp and toss until they turn pink and are opaque, no more than 1 minute. Remove from the pan and set aside. 
Add the egg to the pan and tilt the pan to spread it into a thin sheet. As soon as it begins to set and is opaque, scramble it to break it into small lumps. Remove from the pan and set aside with the shrimp. 
Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, heat for 30 seconds, and add the softened noodles. Using a spatula, spread and pull the noodles into a thin layer covering the surface of the pan. Then scrape them into a clump again and gently turn them over. Hook loops of noodles with the edge of the spatula and pull them up the sides, spreading them out into a layer again. Repeat this process several times as the stiff, white noodles soften and curl into ivory ringlets. Add the fish sauce and turn the noodles so they are evenly seasoned. Add the sugar and peanuts, turning the noodles a few more times. 
Reserving a small handful for garnish, add the bean sprouts, along with the green onions and shrimp-egg mixture. Cook for 1 minute, turning often. Transfer the noodles to the serving platter and squeeze the juice of 2 lime wedges over the top. Garnish with remaining bean sprouts and lime wedges and serve at once. </Instructions>

<Name>Thai Chicken and Coconut Milk Soup (Tom Ka Gai )</Name>
<Author>megatest!sfisher@uu2.psi.com (Scott Fisher) </Author>
<Ingredients>12 oz Canned coconut milk - such as Chaokoh 
1/4 lb Chicken breast - cut into small chunks 
1 Lime; juice and grated peel 
1 4&quot; piece of lemon grass - cut into very thin - (1/16&quot;) slices on the - diagonal 
3 sl Galanga (more if desired) -OR substitute fresh ginger 
Hot chile peppers to taste - cut into thin circles 
Cilantro for garnish </Ingredients>
<Instructions>Pour the lime juice on the chicken and let stand while you prepare the rest of the soup. In a medium saucepan, place the coconut milk, lemon grass, grated lime peel, galanga or ginger, and (optionally) chiles. (The optional part is that if you don&apos;t want the whole dish to taste spicy, add the chiles later; the earlier you add them, the hotter the resulting dish.) Bring the coconut milk to a simmer. 

When the soup is simmering, add the lime-soaked chicken pieces and stir to distribute them. Reduce the heat so the soup stays just below a boil and cook for 12 to 15 minutes, or till the chicken pieces are finished cooking. Remove from heat and serve immediately with fresh cilantro leaves for garnish. 

Now, the *best* way I ever had this soup was with pieces of fresh grouper instead of chicken. I also added slices of kumquats instead of the ginger, and used the sweet Fresno chiles instead of Thai birds. We also served it over Vietnamese rice noodles. Was it southeast Asian or Caribbean? Who cares, it was wonderful. If you can&apos;t find grouper, it&apos;d be good with any tender, delicate white fish -- sole, maybe, or a very fresh sea bass, or maybe little chunks of monkfish. I believe I&apos;ve had this with shrimp as well. (Grouper, BTW, is a type of fish common in the Caribbean and, if I recall, in other warm-water parts of the world; the flesh is very white, very tender, and quite delicately flavored. I&apos;ve seen it in one Asian grocery store in the Bay Area, as well as in the Bahamas, so I&apos;d guess that Gulf Coast netters should be able to find it readily.) 

Notes:
1. Galanga is similar to ginger, an edible rhizome available in most Asian groceries. If not available fresh, you can usually find it frozen. (Well, this is the SF Bay Area; if you can&apos;t find it at Tin Tin or the New Castro Market, you have to have friends smuggle it in from Bangkok for you... Other parts of the country may vary.) 
2. Chile peppers add a lot to the dish; I&apos;ve had it so hot that I could barely eat it, and I&apos;ve had it completely smooth, sweet and mild. I like it in the middle. 
3. Lemon grass adds a lot to the flavor and aroma, but as near as I can tell it isn&apos;t edible unless you puree it. (If there&apos;s sufficient demand, I&apos;ll print my recipe for Vietnamese turkey fajitas.) I just eat around the slices of lemon grass and ginger. </Instructions>

<Notes>Preferably Thai birds, with serranos an acceptable substitute, (though I&apos;ve used sweet Fresno chiles in a variation I&apos;ll describe below)</Notes>

<Instructions>Heat the coconut milk in a pot. Add everything else. As the lemon grass is inedible, put it in a tea ball and immerse the ball in the soup so you can retrieve it later. Cook until the chicken is done and the soup is hot (30 minutes?). Taste to see if it needs more limes (it always does) or more hot peppers (it&apos;s better to start mild and build up to the desired level of spicyness).

NOTES: Although substitutions for hard-to-find ingredients have been made, this curry paste still carries the true flavor of Thailand. Use it in Thai curries unless otherwise specified. A little added to stir-fry dishes or rubbed into chicken as a marinade before barbequing or grilling will add a real Thai accent. A teaspoon added to a meatloaf mixture or meat balls, transforms them into something that is rather exotic, and when combined with peanut butter and coconut milk, it makes a tangy and aromatic sauce for Thai-style satays. 
Use whole spices whenever possible. Anchovy fillets may be substituted for the anchovy paste. Shallots are preferable to onions; if not available, use an equal amount of a red onion. </Instructions>

Push the noodles to one side, pour in about a tablespoon more oil, if necessary, and add the eggs; cook just until slightly set, then break them up. Add the shrimp and stir-fry just until they turn pink. Add most of the bean sprouts, the green onion, and 1/4 cup of the peanuts and stir-fry until the sprouts and onions are crisp-tender, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and transfer to a serving plate. 
Sprinkle with the chopped cilantro, remaining 1/4 cup peanuts, and dried shrimp. Garnish with the remaining bean sprouts, cilantro sprigs, and lemon or lime wedges, and serve immediately. Diners squeeze lemon or lime juice to taste. </Instructions>

2 sl Galanga root - (more if you like - chewing on them.) 
4 Kaffir lime leaves 
Cilantro leaves as desired 
1 ts Chili sauce 
2 tb Fish sauce 
1 1/2 tb Lemon juice 

OPTIONAL: 
Sliced hot peppers (2 or 3 slices per serving) </Ingredients>
<Instructions>* (ad libbed with about 1 tsp or 1 tblsp of powdered thyme) 
** (Some boneless skinless chicken pieces, plus some thighs with the bones bashed once with the back of a knife would be ok too -- the point being to get the flavor from the marrow out.) 
*** as many as you want, cut any way you want, of any kind you want 

 Use a large covered stockpot. Heat olive and sesame oil on high heat. Add cloves, bay leaves, thyme, (these should be pounded a bit first to crack the fibers and release more flavor) and onion, carrots. Cover 2 minutes, stir if you want. 
Add chicken on top, and pour ONE cup of water over the tops of the chicken. Cover. Cook 5 minutes on high. 
Add remainder of water, cover, continue heating till it starts to boil, then turn heat down and simmer covered 30 minutes. Skim off foam occasionally. Remove chicken, debone, and cut into bite sized pieces. Strain soup, avoid getting the sediment at the bottom. (What you do with the leftover veggies after making a stock is up to you. I think they end up in Minnesotan hot dishes....) 
Take 4 cups of the stock, heat until it begins to boil, turn down the heat till it is just simmering. Add galanga, lemongrass, Kaffir lime leaves (bash them a bit to break the fibers--it allows them to release more flavor). Add mushrooms, chicken, (shrimp if you must). Stir in the fish sauce, chili paste. Cover, cook for another 5 minutes. Serve. 
Add lemon juice (just have slices of lemon or lime that you can squeeze) cilantro, and thinly sliced jalepenos or other hot peppers at the table. Fresh liquorice basil also adds a nice touch. </Instructions>
<Serves>1</Serves>
<Notes>We cheated and used Swansons reduced salt chicken stock for the water in the beginning because we used boneless skinless chicken. Can&apos;t tell if it hurt or helped. 
Also had 4 shiitake mushrooms which had been soaking for several days, so they were cut up, and the soaking juice was added along with the chicken and mushrooms. About one cup of this. Big win. Yum</Notes>

1 tb Fresh Ginger Root, Julienne. 
2 tb Onion, Chopped. 
3 tb Fish Sauce. 
1 tb Cilantro, Chopped. 
10 Crushed Hot Chili Peppers. </Ingredients>
<Instructions>Clean and wash the fresh squids, removing all inner matters and skin. Cut through the side so that the meat is in a single &quot;sheet&quot;. Cut the meat into strips about 3/4&quot; to 1&quot; wide and 2&quot; long. If desired, slash one side in a close criss-cross patterns, and the strip will curl into a roll upon cooking. Place the squid pieces into a wire strainer with long handle.
Boil a pot of water, and immerse the strainer with the squid meat into the boiling water to cook. For very fresh squid, cook until the meat had turned opaque and heated through. For frozen, or &quot;not so fresh&quot; squid, it is advisable to cook a little longer. Lift the squid out of the boiling water and let drain in the strainer.
Place the well drained squid meat into a bowl and add fish sauce and lime or lemon juice. Adjust tastes by adding more of either ingredients. The tastes should be tangy sour with sufficient salty tastes. Add lemongrass, ginger roots (very finely julienne), and chopped onions, and mix well. (Optionally, you may add dry ground hot chilli pepper to taste).
Place on a serving platter (lined with lettuce leaves) and topped with chopped scallions, cilantro, mint leaves, and crushed hot chilli peppers</Instructions>

1 Steak dried salt cod 
1 Ripe tomato (or dbl. amt.) peeled, cored and very coarsely chopped 
Salt and pepper to taste 
1 2/3 c Short-grain rice </Ingredients>
<Instructions>Short-grain rice adds the perfect texture to this traditional dish from northern Portugal. The salt cod may eliminate the need for additional salt. 
BROWN THE ONION in the olive oil in a large heavy saucepan over moderate heat. Meanwhile, shred the cod, remove the skin and bones and wash but do not soak. Add the cod to the onion, cover and simmer for about 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes and leave to cook 20-to-30 minutes, covered, over low heat. Meanwhile, wash and drain the rice. Add 3 1/3 cups water to the pan (add twice as much water as there is rice), season to taste with salt and pepper. When the water boils, add the rice and continue to cook on low heat until the rice is done--probably 25-to-30 minutes. Cover the kettle for the last half of cooking. </Instructions>

Dissolve yeast in warm water. Scald milk and add to sugar, butter and salt; stir until butter is melted. Mix cinnamon and flour. Add 1/2 the flour to the milk/sugar/butter/salt, and mix until smooth. Beat 3 eggs and add them and the yeast to the mixture. 
Continue to add remaining flour to make soft dough. Remove it from the bowl and place on floured board. Knead until smooth and satiny (about 15 mins.). Shape into a ball and place in buttered bowl. Cover and let rise until double in size (2-1/2 to 3 hours). 
Punch risen dough down and divide it in half. Place in two greased pans (8 inches round). Let rise in warm place until double in size (1-1/2 to 2 hours). Brush tops of dough with remaining egg (beaten). 
Bake in 350 degree oven for 20-30 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on wire racks. </Instructions>

1 sm Glass dry white wine 
1 Handful coriander leaves; chopped 
4 Slices of bread with the crusts cut off </Ingredients>
<Instructions>This is a real fisherman&apos;s stew, dependent on whatever the boats have brought in. The spices and hervs give the dish its special Portuguese identity. 
Clean the fish and cut into fairly small pieces, removing as many bones as possible. Sprinkle the salt over the fish and leave while you make the following sauce. Heat 2-3 Tbsp of the oil in a saucepan and stir in the onions, tomatoes and pepper. Cook gently until they start to soften, then put in the garlic, nutmeg, allspice and piri-piri sauce. Add the wine and a little water. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently, then remove from the heat. Lightly oil the bottom of a shallow, ovenproff dish (preferably earthenware). Put in a layer of fish followed by a layer of sauce and sprinkle with coriander. Continue with these layers until the ingredients are used up. Cover the top of with the bread and sprikle well with the remaining oil or dot with a little butter. Cook in a pre-heated oven at 350 degrees F. for about 30 minutes or until the fish is tender. Serve with boiled or sliced and fried potatoes, bread and a slad to make a substantial main meal. If you cannot obtain coriander leaves, you can use fresh parsley instead, but this will alter the flavour of the dish. </Instructions>

<Ingredients>1 (10-lb) fresh turkey 
2 lb Coarse (kosher) salt 
1/4 lb Unsalted butter 
3 tb Olive oil 
2 lg Garlic cloves peeled and minced 
1 lb French or Italian bread 
1/2 ts Salt 
1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper 
3 1/2 c Chicken stock 
2 lg Egg yolks </Ingredients>
<Instructions>REMOVE THE GIBLETS from the turkey for another use. Fill the neck and body cavities of the turkey with coarse salt, then rub the skin well all over with salt. Place the turkey and remaining coarse salt in a large deep kettle, adding enough cold water to just cover the bird. Set in a cool spot for 3 to 4 hours. 

TO PREPARE THE STUFFING: 
Put the butter and olive oil in a large heavy saute pan, or better yet, a kettle, and place it over moderate heat. When the butter is melted, add the garlic and cook for 3-5 minutes until limp. Meanwhile, tear the bread into small chunks. Add the bread and the fine salt and pepper and toss well. Pour in the chicken stock and beat hard with a wooden spoon until the mixture is pastelike. Turn the heat to its lowest point, cover the kettle and steam 15-to-20 minutes until the bread absorbs all the liquid. Add the egg yolks to the stuffing mixture and beat hard until smooth. Remove from the heat and reserve. Preheat oven to 400F. Drain the turkey and rinse several times in cool water so that all traces of salt are gone. Place the bird on the counter with the neck cavity facing you. With your hands, begin working the skin free from the breast. Proceed gently, taking care not to tear the skin. It&apos;s slow going at first, but once you begin to free the skin, the job goes quickly. Loosen it all the way down the bird to within about 1 inch of the tail end, down both sides. With your hands, push the stuffing bit by bit far down under the skin and continue, packing it in lightly, until the breast is covered with about a 1-inch layer. Next fill the neck cavity, skewer the neck skin flat against the back to enclose, and truss the bird. Place the turkey breast-side up in a large shallow roasting pan without a rack and roast uncovered for about 2 1/2 hours. Do not baste. When the bird is richly browned and a leg moves easily in the hip joint, remove from the oven. Let stand, uncovered, 20 minutes. Drain drippings into a sauce boat and keep warm. Remove trussing string and skewers and serve at once on a warmed platter.

1 c Finely chopped fresh spinach (leaves only) 
1 1/2 ts Salt 
1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper 
2 tb Olive oil </Ingredients>
<Instructions>SOAK THE GARBANZOS overnight in 6 cups of the water in a large heavy kettle. Next day, add the remaining 2 cups water, bring to a gentle boil, cover, and cook 4-to-5 hours or until the garbanzos are very tender. Meanwhile, stir-fry the garlic and onions in the peanut oil in a second large, heavy kettle over moderate heat for 12-to-15 minutes until lightly browned. Add the potatoes and stir-fry 2-to-3 minutes; add the thyme, coriander, and bay leaf, turn the heat down low, and allow to mellow about 10 minutes. Pour in the broth, bring all to a gentle simmer, cover and cook slowly. As soon as you&apos;ve set the 2 kettles to simmer, stir-fry the pepperoni in a large heavy skillet 3-to-5 minutes--just until lightly browned and most of the drippings have cooked out. Drain the pepperoni well, reserving 1 tablespoon of the drippings. Set aside. Return 1 tablespoon drippings to the skillet, add the spinach and stir-fry 2-to-3 minutes over moderate heat just until glazed and intensely green; reserve. When the garbanzos are tender, puree 1/2 of them by buzzing 60 seconds in a food processor, adding only enough kettle liquid to puree them easily. Return the pureed garbanzos to the kettle in which they cooked. Now puree the potato mixture in 2 batches, buzzing each 30-to-40 seconds in a food processor. Blend the potato mixture into the garbanzo mixture, add the reserved pepperoni and spinach, cover, and simmer 30-to-40 minutes--just long enough to mellow the flavors. Season to taste with salt and pepper, remove the bay leaf, then smooth in the olive oil. </Instructions>

<Name>Cabbage Rolls (Polish Style)</Name>
<Author>?</Author>
<Ingredients>2 lb Ground Beef, lean 
1/2 c Rice, uncooked 
1 md Onion, Diced 
1 Green Pepper, Diced 
2 Eggs 
1 lg Head Cabbage 
2 qt Tomato Juice </Ingredients>
<Instructions>PREPARE THE CABBAGE LEAVES: 
The Old timers would freeze the head solid, then peel the leaves from the head as they thawed. The best way I&apos;ve found is to 1)cut the core out with a knife, then put the hole-where-the-core- was, side down in a steamer over boiling water. Let it sit for about 10 minutes and remove. Several layers of the outer leaves should be soft enough to remove from the head. When you&apos;ve removed as many as you can, return the head to the steamer to soften more leaves. Take a sharp knife and remove as much of the central vein as you can. 

FILLING: Mix all the other ingredients together in a bowl. work it with your hands until the eggs and other ingredients except the tomato juice are thoroughly mixed into the meat. Now, take a glob of mixture and set it in the hollow of a deveined leaf,with the end that was near the core towards you. Fold the end nearest you about / way over the mix. Fold the left side over the mix and then the right side. Roll about / turn away from you so that the &quot;seam&quot; is on the bottom. Place in the pan seam side don and continue with the other leaves.* When you&apos;ve made the last cabbage roll,pour in the tomato juice to cover. Bring to a boil then simmer for AT LEAST an hour. Serve in a bowl with the juice, although these, like spaghetti are better the 2nd day. 

*This is an ideal cabbage roll. 3/4 of them won&apos;t go together this perfectly, so be ready to make adjustments when making the rolls. 

VARIATIONS: 
Garlic is great, paprika and chili powder will work in the stuffing, V-8 instead of tomato juice is pleasantly different. </Instructions>

<Author>Elisabeth Luard</Author>
<Ingredients>1 lb Dried white beans (navy or cannellini) 
2 Onions, chopped 
3 Cloves garlic, minced 
3 Bay leaves 
2 tb Chopped parsley 
2 tb Tomato paste 
1 lg Carrot, scraped and sliced 
5 To 6 whole peppercorns 
1 lb Kielbasa, thickly sliced 
1/2 tb Salt 
2 tb Olive oil 
1 ts Paprika 
2 tb Flour </Ingredients>
<Instructions>You will need a large saucepan. Pick over the beans for bits of grit and chaff, and rinse them twice in cold water. Put the beans in a large saucepan and cover them with water to a depth of 1 to 2 inches. Bring the water to a boil and then turn down the heat. Leave to simmer gently for half an hour. 
Remove the pan from the heat and pour in enough cold water to cover the beans to a depth of 3 inches. The beans will settle on the bottom. Leave them for a minute or two; then pour off the water and replace with fresh water. Bring the water to a boil and then turn down the heat to simmer. 
Add the onions, garlic, bay leaves, parsley, tomato paste, carrot, and peppercorns to the beans. Cook gently over very low heat for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until the beans are soft. After 45 minutes of the cooking, add the kielbasa. 
Fifteen minutes before you are ready to serve, add the salt and prepare a liaison for the soup. Heat the oil until it is smoking lightly; then quickly stir in the paprika, followed by the flour. Mix to a thin paste. Add this to the soup, stirring well. Simmer for 5 minutes, until the soup is thick and rich. 
Serve with plenty of bread and good red wine. </Instructions>

<Author>New York Cookbook, Molly O&apos;Neill</Author>
<Ingredients>SOURDOUGH STARTER: 
2 c Cold water 
6 c Rye flour 
1 ts Active dry yeast 
============================ 

BREAD: 
4 c Warm water (105-110 F) 
5 1/2 c Rye flour 
5 1/2 c All purpose flour 
2 tb Salt 
4 pk Dry yeast dissolved in 1/4 cup warm water (105-110F) 
1/4 c Ground cornmeal 
2 ts Caraway seeds </Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Start sourdough starter at least 3 days before baking: Combine the cold water, rye flour, and yeast in a bowl. Mix well; it will be lumpy. Pour the mixture in a clean bowl, cover with a cloth, and refrigerate for 3 days. 
2. Remove the starter from the refrigerator 2 hours before beginning to make the bread. 
3. Transfer the starter to a large bowl and add the warm water, yeast, flours, salt, cornmeal and caraway seeds and mix until smooth, 5 minutes. 
4. Divide the dough in half. Shape into 2 even rounds. Place each round in a lightly greased bowl, cover with a clean cloth, and set aside to rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1-2 hrs. 
5. Place a roasting pan on the bottom of the oven and fill with hot water. Preheat the oven to 400F. Sprinkle a baking sheet with corn- meal. 
6. Dampen your hands and reshape the bread into even round mounds. Place the loaves on a prepared baking sheet. Bake the bread until crusty, about 2 hours. If the water in the roasting pan runs low during the baking, replenish it to provide the bread with steam heat. Cool, or serve warm. </Instructions>

<Instructions>Finely slice green onions; reserve 1/4 cup of the green tops for garnish. In a deep microwaveable casserole bowl or 8 cup measure, combine onions. rice, tomatoes and their liquid, broth, thyme, pepper and salt (dish needs to be twice the height of these combined ingredients). 
Cover dish tightly and microwave on high (100% power) for 16 minutes, rotating the dish a quarter turn halfway through cooking. 
Remove the dish from microwave; stir in peas. Arrange mussels and shrimp alternately around the edge of dish, sticking mussels upright into the rice mixture and shrimp head down and tail toward center (they do not need to be completely covered with liquid). Arrange fish pieces in an even layer in center, on top of the rice mixture. 
Cover and microwave on high until most of the fish has turned opaque throughout and mussels open, 5 to 8 minutes more. Mixture will look saucy. Let stand, covered, about 3 minutes for fish to finish cooking. Serve in wide shallow bowls and sprinkle with reserved green onions over each serving. Makes 4 servings.

Just snag yourself a large can of tomato sauce and a few other common ingredients and get simmering. These recipes duplicate the traditional &quot;Meat&quot; variety of the sauce and the newer &quot;Chunky Garden Style&quot; version with tomato, basil and Italian cheese. Feel free to doctor these sauces up with your own creative additions just as many do to perk up real Ragu.

<Notes>This creamy green sauce is available at the salsa bar at each of the 300 El Pollo Loco outlets located throughout the western U.S., and folks are going crazy over it. The problem is, you can only get it at the restaurants in small quantities -- time to put on our kitchen cloning hat. Use a food processor to mix this one up (everything but the cilantro and onion goes in there) and prepare for a delicious, spicy concoction that you can pour over your favorite homemade Mexican-style dishes, from tacos salads to fajitas. Pancho Ochoa opened his first roadside chicken stand in Guasave, Mexico in 1975, and now El Pollo Loco is the number one quick-service, flame-broiled chicken chain in America.

<Notes>This is the spicy sauce that you can order on your Gordita or Chalupa at Taco Bell, but you won&apos;t get much extra sauce -- even if you order it on the side  -- to use later at home. Too bad, since this stuff is good enough to use on all sorts of homemade Mexican masterpieces, from tacos to fajitas to breakfast burritos. Now, with this original TSR clone of the creamy sauce, you&apos;ll have enough to hold you over for a while. You need a food processor to puree the vegetables, but don&apos;t expect to use all the puree. I&apos;ve made the measurements for the puree larger than required so that your food processor will have something to grab onto. And, by the way, this is a mayo-based sauce, so if you want to knock down the fat grams, use light mayonnaise in the recipe. You won&apos;t even be able to tell the difference.

<Name>Baked French Onion Soup</Name>
<Author>Todd Wilbur</Author>
<Ingredients>3 tablespoons vegetable oil
6 medium white onions, sliced
8 cups beef broth (Swanson is best)
1 cup water
2 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
5 plain hamburger buns
10 slices provolone cheese
10 teaspoons shredded parmesan cheese</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Add 3 tablespoons oil to a large soup pot or saucepan over medium/high heat. Add the sliced onions and sauté for 20 minutes until the onions begin to soften and start to become translucent. You don&apos;t want them to brown.
2. Add the beef broth, water, salt, garlic powder and black pepper to the pan and bring mixture to a boil. When soup begins to boil, reduce heat and simmer for 45 minutes.
3. To make the croutons cut off the top half of each top of the hamburger bun so that the bread is the same thickness as the bottom half of each bun. Throw the tops away. Now you should have 10 round pieces of bread -- 5 bottom buns, and 5 top buns with the tops cut off. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Place the bread in the the oven directly on the rack and bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until each piece is golden brown and crispy. Set these croutons aside until you need them.
4. When the soup is done, spoon about 1 cup into an oven-safe bowl. Float a crouton on top of the soup, then place a slice of provolone cheese on top of the crouton. Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon of shredded parmesan cheese over the provolone.
5. Place the bowl into your oven set to high broil. Broil the soup for 5 to 6 minutes or until the cheese is melted and starting to brown (you may need to broil longer if you are making more than one bowl at a time). Sprinkle an additional 1/2 teaspoon of shredded parmesan cheese over the top of the soup and serve. Repeat process to prepare remaining servings</Instructions>

Just be sure you have some oven-safe soup bowls for this one, since we&apos;ll have to broil it a bit before serving. Under the gooey melted provolone of the original version you get from Applebee&apos;s is a unique round crouton that&apos;s made from bread similar to a hamburger bun.

As with any salad, the waistline violator is the traditionally fat-filled dressing that’s drizzled in gobs over the top of very healthy greens (a tablespoon of dressing is usually around 10-12 grams of fat each). So if we can just figure out a cool way to make the dressing fat-free, we’re well on our way to making huge salad – four of them to be exact – with only 12 grams of fat on the entire plate. Most of those grams come from the chicken breast, while the crunchy chow mein noodles pick up the rest. Just be sure to plan ahead when you make this one. The chicken should marinate for a few hours if you want it to taste like the original. Get ready for some big, meal-size salads.  </Notes>

<Name>Low-Fat Blackened Chicken Salad</Name>
<Author>Todd Wilbur</Author>
<Ingredients>Dressing
1/4 cup fat free mayonnaise
1/4 cup Grey Poupon Dijon mustard
1/4 cup honey
1 tablespoon prepared mustard
1 tablespoon white vinegar
1/8 teaspoon paprika

Chicken Marinade
1 cup water
3 tablespoons lime juice
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1/2 tablespoon Worcestershire

Cajun Spice Blend
1/2 tablespoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon white pepper

2 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
2 tablespoons light butter

Salad
8 cups chopped iceberg lettuce
1/2 cup shredded red cabbage
1/2 cup shredded carrot
1/2 cup fat free shredded mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup fat free shredded cheddar cheese
1 large tomato, diced
1 hardboiled egg white, diced
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Make dressing by combining ingredients in a small bowl. Mix well by hand. Store in a covered container in the refrigerator until salad is ready.
2. Combine water, lime juice, soy sauce, and Worcestershire in a medium bowl, and stir. Add the chicken breasts to the marinade, cover bowl and keep in refrigerator for several hours. Overnight is even better.
3. When chicken is marinated, preheat a frying pan or skillet (an iron skillet, if you’ve got it) over medium/high heat. Also, preheat your barbecue grill to medium/high heat.
4. Combine the spices for the Cajun spice blend in a small bowl. Sprinkle a teaspoon of the spice blend over one side of each of the chicken breasts. Cover the entire surface of the chicken with spice. 
5. Melt the butter in the hot pan, then sear the chicken breasts for 2-3 minutes on the side with the spices. While first side cooks, sprinkle another teaspoon of spice over the top of each chicken breast, coating that side as you did the other. Flip the chicken over, and sear for another 2-3 minutes. The surface of the chicken will be coated with a charred, black layer of flavor. This is exactly what you are shooting for.
6. Finish the chicken off on your barbecue grill. Grill each breast on both sides for 2-3 minutes, or until they are done.
7. While chicken is cooking prepare the salads by splitting the lettuce into two large bowls. Toss in the red cabbage and carrots. Mix the cheeses together, then top the salad with the cheeses and hardboiled egg. Sprinkle the diced tomato on each salad.
8. Slice the chicken breast, across each breast in 1/2-inch-thick slices. Spread the chicken over the top of the salad and serve immediately with dressing on the side.

<Notes>Menu Description: &quot;Our non-fat Honey Mustard dressing &amp; non-fat Cheddar/Mozzarella blend give this Blackened Chicken Salad the same great taste as our original &amp; less than 5 grams of fat.&quot;

Applebee&apos;s original Blackened Chicken Salad quickly became a favorite, encouraging this popular full-service chain to create a low-fat version of the delish dish. While most of the fat in the original comes from the tasty honey mustard dressing, this version creates a dressing that tastes just as good, yet has not a single gram of fat. Combine that with fresh lettuce, shredded carrot, a little egg white, non-fat shredded cheese, and a delicious Cajun spice blend which generously coats chicken seared in light butter then grilled, and you have a majorly munchable salad which is incredibly easy on the waistline. Who says you need gobs of fat to create a tasty meal?

<Notes>Menu Description: &quot;Crisp Oriental greens topped with chunks of crunchy Chicken Fingers, toasted almonds &amp; crispy rice noodles tossed in a light Oriental vinaigrette.&quot; 

Applebee&apos;s 60-item menu is revised twice a year. That means about 40 percent of the entire menu changes on a regular basis. The other 60 percent are items that are found on menus in all of the Applebee&apos;s restaurants, and seldom ever change. One item that has been on the menu for some time now is this Oriental Chicken salad, which is considered one of the restaurant&apos;s signature items. The recipe makes one dinner-size salad and can be easily doubled or quadrupled for additional servings. This recipe comes from the third book, &quot;Top Secret Restaurant Recipes,&quot; but the dressing has been improved to more closely match the current dressing served at the restaurant.

<Ingredients>Marinade
1 cup water
1/3 cup teriyaki sauce
2 tablespoons lime juice
2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 teaspoon mesquite liquid smoke flavoring
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon tequila

4 chicken breast fillets

Mexi-Ranch Dressing
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup sour cream
1 tablespoon milk
2 teaspoons minced tomato
1 1/2 teaspoons white vinegar
1 teaspoon minced canned jalapeno slices (nacho slices)
1 teaspoon minced onion
1/4 teaspoon dried parsley
1/4 teaspoon Tabasco pepper sauce
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon dried dill weed
1/8 teaspoon paprika
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/8 teaspoon cumin
1/8 teaspoon chili powder
dash garlic powder
dash ground black pepper</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1 cup shredded cheddar/monterey jack cheese blend
2 cups crumbled corn chips or fried tortilla strips (see tidbits)
 



 

1. Prepare marinade by combining marinade ingredients in a medium bowl. Add the chicken to the bowl, cover and chill for 2 to 3 hours.
2. Make the mexi-ranch dressing by combining all of the ingredients in a medium bowl. Mix well until smooth, then cover dressing and chill it until needed.
3. When you are ready to prepare the entree, preheat the oven to high broil. Also, preheat your barbecue or indoor grill to high heat. When the grill is hot cook the marinated chicken breasts for 3 to 5 minutes per side, or until they&apos;re done.
4. Arrange the cooked chicken in a baking pan. Spread a layer of mexi-ranch dressing over each piece of chicken (you&apos;ll have plenty left over), followed by 1/4 cup of the shredded cheese blend. Broil the chicken for 2 to 3 minutes, or just until the cheese has melted.
5. Spread a bed of 1/2 cup of the tortilla strips or crumbled corn chips on each of four plates. Slide a chicken breast onto the chips on each plate and serve with your choice of rice, and pico de gallo, or salsa. (http://www.topsecretrecipes.com)
Serves 4.

Tidbits
Crumbling store-bought tortilla chips is the easy way to make the bed of crunchy chips that the tequila lime chicken rests on. But, you can make tortilla strips like those served at the restaurant by cutting a stack of eight 6-inch corn tortillas in half. Stack the halves on top of each other and slice the tortillas into thin strips. Fry the tortilla strips in 2 cups of oil preheated in a large skillet for 3-5 minutes or until crispy. Salt lightly and cool on paper towels to drain.</Instructions>
<Serves>0</Serves>
<Notes>It&apos;s one of Applebee&apos;s top-selling signature dishes and a big request here on the site. This tasty dish combines the tangy flavor of the tequila lime marinade with creamy southwestern-style dressing, and tops it all off with a melted cheese blend. Just be sure you don&apos;t marinate the chicken longer than the 3 to 4 hours, or the citric acid in the lime juice may toughen the chicken. The bed of crispy corn tortilla strips can be easily cloned with crumbled store-bought corn chips, but if you want strips like those served at the restaurant, just follow the &quot;tidbits&quot; below. Serve this dish with your choice of rice (Spanish rice is recommended), along with some pico de gallo (you can find a recipe here) or salsa on the side.</Notes>

<Author>Todd Wilbur</Author>
<Ingredients>Centers
1/4 cup whole milk
5 unwrapped caramels
1 tablespoon light corn syrup
1 teaspoon butter
1/4 teaspoon vanilla
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 cups powdered sugar

20 unwrapped caramels 
1 1/2 teaspoons water
2 cups dry roasted peanuts
1 12-ounce bag milk chocolate chips</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Combine all ingredients for the centers, except the powdered sugar, in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir often as the caramel slowly melts. When the mixture is smooth, add 3/4 cup of powdered sugar. Stir. Save the remaining 1/2 cup of powdered sugar for later. 
2. Use a candy thermometer to bring the mixture to exactly 230 degrees, stirring often, then turn off the heat.
3. When the temperature of the candy begins to drop, add the remaining 1/2 cup powdered sugar to the pan, then use a hand mixer on high speed to combine. Keep mixing until the candy cools and thickens and can no longer be mixed. That should take a minute or two.
4. Let the candy cool in the pan for 10 to 15 minutes, or until it can be touched. Don&apos;t let it sit too long - you want the candy to still be warm and pliable when you shape it. Take a tablespoon-size portion and roll it between your palms or on a countertop until it forms a roll the width of your index finger, and measuring about 4 1/2-inches long. Repeat with the remaining center candy mixture and place the rolls on wax paper. You should have 8 rolls. Let the center rolls sit out for an hour or two to firm up.   
5. Combine the 20 caramels with the 1 1/2 teaspoons of water in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir often until the caramels melt completely, then turn off the heat. If you work fast this caramel will stay warm while you make the candy bars.
6. Pour the peanuts onto a baking sheet or other flat surface. Using a basting brush and working quickly, &quot;paint&quot; a coating of caramel onto one side of a center roll. Quickly turn the center over, caramel side down, onto the peanuts and press gently so that the peanuts stick to the surface of the candy. Paint more caramel onto the other side of the roll and press it down onto the peanuts. The candy should have a solid layer of peanuts covering all sides. If needed, brush additional caramel onto the roll, then turn it onto the peanuts to coat the roll completely. Place the candy bar onto wax paper, and repeat with the remaining ingredients. Place these bars into your refrigerator for an hour or two so that they firm up.
7. Pour the milk chocolate chips into a glass or ceramic bowl and zap it in the microwave for 2 minutes on 50 percent power. Gently stir the chips, then heat for an additional 30 seconds at 50 percent power. Repeat if necessary, stirring gently after each 30 seconds. Don&apos;t overcook the chips or the chocolate will burn and seize up on you. 
8. Drop a candy bar center into the melted milk chocolate. Cover the candy bar with chocolate using two forks, one in each hand. When the candy is covered with chocolate, balance the bar on both of the forks, one at each end of the candy bar, and tap the forks on the top edge of the bowl so that much of the chocolate drops off. Carefully place the candy bar onto wax paper and remove the two forks. Repeat with the remaining ingredients, and then chill the candy bars until firm.</Instructions>

<Name>Ice Cream Cake</Name>
<Author>Todd Wilbur</Author>
<Ingredients>Cake
1 box white cake mix
1 1/4 cups water
1/3 cup vegetable oil
3 egg whites

1/2-gallon box pralines and cream ice cream 
4 cups (2 pints) vanilla ice cream 
1 12-ounce container white frosting 

Optional
colored frosting </Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Make your cake following the directions on the box. If you are making the white cake you will likely blend the cake mix with water, oil, and 3 eggs. Pour the batter into a greased 9 x 13-inch baking pan and bake at 350 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes. This will make a thin cake for our bottom layer.  When cake is done, let it cool to room temperature.
2. When the cake has cooled, carefully remove it from the pan and place it on a wax paper-covered cookie sheet, or a platter or tray that will fit into your freezer. 
3.  Use a sharp serrated knife (a bread knife works great) to slice the ice cream lengthwise through the middle, box and all, so that you have two 2-inch thick sheets of ice cream.  Peel the cardboard off the ice cream and lay the halves next to each other on the cake.  Slice the edges of the cake all the way around so that the cake is the same size as the ice cream on top.  Work quickly so that the ice cream doesn&apos;t melt.  When the cake has been trimmed, place it into the freezer for an hour or two.
4.  When you are ready to frost the cake, take the two pints (4 cups) of vanilla ice cream out of the freezer for 20 to 30 minutes to soften.  Sitr the ice cream so that it is smooth, like frosting.  Use a frosting knife or spatula to coat your cake with about 2 cups of ice cream.  Cover the entire surface thoroughly so that you cannot see any of the cake or ice cream underneath.  Pop the cake into the freezer for an hour or so to set up.  
5.  When the cake has set, fill a pastry bag (with a fancy tip) with white frosting to decorate all around the top edge of the cake.  Also decorate around the bottom of the cake.  Use colored frosting and different tips to add inspired artistic flair and writing on the cake, as needed.  Cover the cake with plastic wrap and keep it in your freezer until party time.
6.  When you are ready to serve the cake, leave it out for 10 minutes before slicing.  Cut the cake with a sharp knife that has been held under hot water. (http://www.topsecretrecipes.com)

<Notes>Traditional white birthday cakes are pretty boring by themselves.  Scoop a little ice cream onto the plate and I&apos;ll perk up a bit.  But, hey baby, bring a Baskin-Robbins ice cream cake to the party and I&apos;ll be the first one in line with a plastic fork.  This 4500-unit ice cream chain stacks several varieties of pre-made ice cream cakes in its freezer, but I&apos;ve discovered the most popular version, over and over again, is the one made from white cake with pralines and cream ice cream on top.  So that&apos;s got to be the version we clone here.  But don&apos;t think you&apos;re locked into this formula - you can use any flavor of cake and ice cream you fancy for your homemade masterpiece.  Just be sure the ice cream you choose comes in a box.  It should be rectangular shape so that the ice cream layer stacks up right.  Then you&apos;ll want to find a real sharp serrated knife to cut the ice cream in half while it&apos;s in the box.  And check this out:  That white stuff that coats the cake is actually softened ice cream spread on a thin layer like frosting, and then re-frozen.  After it sets up, you can decorate the cake any way you like with pre-made frosting in whatever color suits your festive occasion.  Voilà!  You&apos;ve just made an ice cream cake at home that looks and tastes like those in the stores that costs around 35 buck each. </Notes>

<Ingredients>1 cup tomato sauce

6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
dash garlic powder</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
2. Combine the tomato sauce, barbecue sauce, and sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat. Heat the mixture until it begins to bubble, stirring often, then remove it from the heat.
3. In a large bowl, add all but 2 tablespoons of the tomato sauce to the meat. Use a large wooden spoon or your hands to work the sauce into the meat until it is very well combined.
4. Combine the remaining ingredients with the ground sirloin - flour, salt, onion powder, ground pepper, and garlic powder. Use the wooden spoon or your hands to work the spices and flour into the meat.
5. Load the meat into a loaf pan (preferably a meatloaf pan with two sections that allows the fat to drain, but if you don&apos;t have one of those a regular loaf pan will work). Wrap foil over the pan and place it into the oven for 30 minutes.
6. After 30 minutes, take the meatloaf from the oven, remove the foil and, if you aren&apos;t using a meatloaf pan, drain the fat.
7. Using a knife, slice the meatloaf all the way through into 8 slices while it is still in the pan. This will help to cook the center of the meatloaf. Pour the remaining 2 tablespoons of sauce over the top of the meatloaf, in a stream down the center. Don&apos;t spread the sauce.
8. Place the meatloaf back into the oven, uncovered, for 25 - 30 minutes or until it is done. Remove and allow it to cool for a few minutes before serving.</Instructions>

<Notes>In the early 90s Boston Chicken was on a roll.  The home meal replacement chain&apos;s stock was soaring and the lines were filled with hungry customers waiting to sink their teeth into a serving of the chain&apos;s delicious rotisserie chicken.  So successful was the chain with chicken, that the company quickly decided it was time to introduce other entrée selections, the first of which was a delicious barbecue sauce-covered ground sirloin meatloaf.  But offering the other entrées presented the company with a dilemma: what to do about the name.  The bigwigs decided it was time to change the name to Boston Market, to reflect a wider menu.  That meant replacing signs on hundreds of units and retooling the marketing campaigns.  That name change, plus rapid expansion of the chain and growth of other similar home-style meal concepts sent the company into a tailspin.  By 1988, Boston Market&apos;s goose was cooked:  the company filed for bankruptcy.  Soon McDonald&apos;s stepped in to purchase the company, with the idea of closing many of the stores for good, and slapping Golden Arches on the rest.  But that plan was scrapped when, after selling many of the under-performing Boston Markets, the chain began to fly once again.  Within a year of the acquisition Boston Market was profitable, and those meals with the home-cooked taste are still being served at over 700 Boston Market restaurants across the country.</Notes>

5. As the meat cooks, brown the faces of the buns in a hot skillet, toaster oven, or face down on the grill. Watch the buns closely so that they do not burn.
6. Build each burger by first spreading a tablespoon of the spread on the face of the top bun. Arrange about 1/3 cup of lettuce evenly over the spread.
7. On the bottom bun stack a patty, then a slice of American cheese, another patty, and another slice of cheese.
8. On the top slice of cheese arrange 2-3 separated onion slices (rings), then 2 pickle slices.
9. Turn the top part of the burger over onto the bottom and serve. You may also want to zap the sandwiches in the microwave, individually, for 15 to 20 seconds each.</Instructions>

<Notes>The Burger Wars are becoming the biggest food fight since that cafeteria scene from the movie &quot;Animal House&quot;.  The two burger giants, McDonald&apos;s and Burger King, have each been cloning the other&apos;s top products in the bloody battle for the big burger buck.  Burger King stepped up first with the Big King - Burger King&apos;s version of the McDonald&apos;s Big Mac.  Yes, it had two all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun; although everything was arranged a bit differently, and there&apos;s no middle bun in there.  Then McDonald&apos;s rolled out the Big N&apos; Tasty, which bore a striking resemblance to Burger King&apos;s Whopper, with fresh lettuce, tomato, and onion on top of a huge beef patty.  Who&apos;s winning this fight by leveraging the popularity of the other company&apos;s product?  Nobody, really.  McDonald&apos;s chose to alter its Big N&apos; Tasty recipe by making it smaller n&apos; cheaper, then changed the name to Big Xtra!, while Burger King bailed out on the Big King altogether.  But this food fight is far from over.  More recently Burger King tweaked its french fry formula in an unsuccessful attempt to steal away fans from McDonald&apos;s winning fried spuds recipe.  And McDonald&apos;s has added more breakfast sandwiches to compete with Burger King&apos;s wider wake-up selection.  So the war continues.  And the battlefield is splattered with ketchup.</Notes>

<Name>Burger King®Breakfast Sandwiches</Name>
<Author>Todd Wilbur</Author>
<Ingredients>Biscuit Sandwich
1 small can (5 biscuits) Pillsbury Grands Buttermilk Biscuits  
melted butter
Non-stick cooking spray
5 eggs
salt
ground black pepper
10 ounces ground breakfast sausage (such as Jimmy Dean) or 10 slices of bacon 
5 slices American cheese</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Prepare biscuits following instructions on the can (bake at 350 degrees for 15 to 18 minutes). When you remove the biscuits from the oven brush the top of each with melted butter.  
2. Spray a skillet over medium heat with non-stick cooking spray. Open both ends of a clean, small, sliced pineapple can. Spray the inside of the empty can with the non-stick spray, and then place the can in the pan to heat up. Use more than one can if you&apos;d like to speed up the cooking process.
3. Beat an egg, then pour it into the empty can mold, add a bit of salt and pepper, and cover with a saucepan lid. Cook for a couple minutes, then scrape a knife around the edge of the egg to release it. Remove the can, then turn the egg over and cook it for another minute or two. Repeat with the remaining eggs. 
4. If using sausage, form 2-ounce portions of sausage into patties with the same diameter as the biscuits. Cook the sausage in another hot skillet over medium heat until brown. If using bacon, cook the bacon and drain on paper towels.  
5. Slice a biscuit in half through the middle. Build each sandwich by first stacking egg on the bottom half of the biscuit. Next arrange sausage (or 2 slices of bacon) on the egg, then a slice of American cheese. Top off each sandwich with the top biscuit half, then zap it in the microwave for 15 to 20 seconds to help melt the cheese. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. </Instructions>
<Serves>5</Serves>
<Notes>You can have your eggs and sausage and biscuits sitting next to each other on the plate like all the traditional folks out there, or you can get vertical with this top secret breakfast-in-sandwich from the world&apos;s number two fast food chain.  And if you prefer a croissant to a biscuit, I&apos;ve got that version for you, too (along with the special way to get bigger, circular croissants).  A great way to make the eggs for these breakfast sandwiches is to pour the beaten egg into a well-greased mold made from an empty pineapple can.  Just cut both ends off an 8-ounce pineapple can - you know, the short cans that have crushed or sliced pineapple inside.  Oh, and take the pineapple out.  Then, before you know it, you&apos;ll be making perfectly round eggs like the fast food pros. </Notes>

<Name>Dakota Smashed Pea &amp; Barley Soup</Name>
<Author>Todd Wilbur</Author>
<Ingredients>2 cups split peas
6 cups water 
2 14.5-ounce cans chicken broth (4 cups) 
1/3 cup minced onion 
1 large clove garlic, minced 
2 teaspoons lemon juice 
1 teaspoon salt 
1 teaspoon granulated sugar 
1/4 teaspoon dried parsley 
1/4 teaspoon white pepper
dash dried thyme
1/2 cup barley
6 cups water
2 medium carrots, diced (about 1 cup) 
1/2 stalk celery, diced (1/4 cup)

Garnish
chopped green onion</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Rinse and drain the split peas, then add them to a large pot with 6 cups of water, chicken broth, onion, garlic, lemon juice, salt, sugar, parsley, pepper, and thyme. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 75 minutes or until the peas are soft.
2. While the peas are cooking, combine the barley with 6 cups of water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 75 minutes or until the barley is soft and most of the water has been absorbed.
3. When the split pea mixture has become a thick soup, use a handheld blender to puree the peas until the mixture is smooth. You may also use a standard blender or food processor for this step, pureeing the soup in batches. Alternately, if you like, you may skip this step, keeping the soup rather chunky. It&apos;s still good this way, just not as smooth as the real thing.
4. Drain the barley mixture in a sieve or colander and add it to the split pea mixture. Add the carrots and celery and continue to simmer the soup for 15 to 30 minutes or until the carrots are tender. Stir occasionally. Turn off the heat, cover the soup, and let it sit for 10 to 15 minutes before serving.  Garnish each serving with a little chopped green onion. </Instructions>
<Serves>8</Serves>
<Notes>Got one of those cool hand blenders? You know, the kind of gadget that used to be pitched on those annoying yet compelling late-night infomercials? It comes in handy for this recipe, which requires the split peas to be smashed into a smooth consistency, just like the original. If you don&apos;t have a hand mixer, a standard blender works just fine. This soup is very tasty and very low in fat. And the barley gives it a special chunky consistency and added flavor that isn&apos;t found in most pea soups.</Notes>

<Ingredients>Ranch Dressing

1/3 cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons sour cream
1 tablespoon buttermilk
1 1/2 teaspoons white vinegar
1 teaspoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon lemon juice
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon parsley
1/8 teaspoon onion powder
dash dill weed
dash garlic powder
dash ground black pepper
2 teaspoons hot water
1/2 teaspoon unflavored gelatin

6 to 8 cups vegetable shortening
1 egg
1 cup water
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
4 chicken breast fillets
4 sesame seed hamburger buns
4 lettuce leaves
4 tomato slices
Kraft Swiss cheese Singles
8 slices bacon, cooked</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Preheat 6 to 8 cups of shortening in a deep fryer to 350 degrees.  If you don&apos;t have a deep fryer, you can also pan fry using a large frying pan and just a couple cups of shortening.
2. To prepare the ranch dressing, combine all of the ingredients except the water and gelatin in small bowl. Mix the water with the gelatin in a small cup until all of the gelatin is dissolved. Add this gelatin solution to the other ingredients and stir. Cover and chill the dressing until it&apos;s needed.
3. Beat the egg and then combine with 1 cup water in a small, shallow bowl. Stir.
4. Combine the flour, salt, paprika, onion powder and garlic powder in another shallow bowl.
5. Pound each of the breast fillets with a mallet until about 1/4-inch thick. Trim each breast fillet until it is round.
6. Working with one fillet at a time, first coat each fillet with the flour, then dredge it in the egg and water mixture. Coat the chicken once again in the flour and set it aside until all of the fillets have been coated.
7. Fry the chicken fillets for 8 to 12 minutes or until light brown and crispy.
8. As chicken is frying, prepare each sandwich by grilling the face of the hamburger buns on a hot skillet over medium heat. Spread about 1 1/2 teaspoons of the ranch dressing on the face of the top and bottom buns.
9. On the bottom bun, stack a leaf of lettuce and a tomato slice.
10. When the chicken is done frying, remove the fillets from the fryer and drain them on paper towels or a rack for a couple minutes.
11. Stack one fillet on the bottom of the sandwich (on top of the tomato), then stack a slice of the Swiss cheese onto the chicken. 
12. Arrange the bacon, crosswise, on top of the Swiss cheese, then top off the sandwich with the top bun. Repeat the stacking process for each of the remaining sandwiches. </Instructions>

<Name>Nabisco®Cheese Nips®</Name>
<Author>Todd Wilbur</Author>
<Ingredients>1 cup sifted all-purpose flour (plus 1/2 cup divided and reserved for kneading and rolling)
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup Kraft Macaroni &amp; Cheese Cheese Topping powder (or 2 packages dry cheese powder from 2 boxes Kraft macaroni &amp; cheese)
3 tablespoons shortening
1/3 cup buttermilk
1/2 teaspoon salt (for tops, optional)</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Sift together 1 cup flour, baking soda, baking powder, and cheese powder in a large bowl.
2. Cut in the shortening with a fork and knife with a crosswise motion until dough is broken down into rice-size pieces. Mixture will still be very dry.
3. Stir in buttermilk with a fork until dough becomes very moist and sticky.
4. Sprinkle a couple tablespoons of the reserved flour over the dough and work it in until the dough can be handled without sticking, then turn it out onto a floured board, being sure to keep 1/4 cup of the reserve flour for later. Knead the dough well for 60 to 90 seconds, until the flour is well incorporated. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and chill for at least one hour.
5. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Spray a light coating of cooking spray on a baking sheet.
6. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and use the remaining reserve flour to dust a rolling surface. Roll about one-third of the dough to just under 1/16th of inch thick. Trim the edges square (a pizza cutter or wheel works great for this), then transfer the dough to a lightly greased baking sheet. Use the rolling pin to transfer the dough. Simply pick up one end of the dough onto a rolling pin, and roll the dough around the rolling pin. Reverse the process onto the baking sheet to transfer the dough.
7. Use a pizza cutter to cut across and down the dough, creating 1-inch square pieces. Use the blunt end of a skewer or broken toothpick to poke a hole in the center of each piece.
8. Sprinkle a very light coating of salt over the top of the crackers (crackers will already be quite salty) and bake for 8 to 10 minutes mix the crackers around (so those on the edge don’t burn) and bake for another 3 to 5 minutes, or until some are just barely turning a light brown. Repeat the rolling and baking process with the remaining dough. 

Makes approximately 300 crackers. </Instructions>

<Name>Chevys®Fresh Salsa</Name>
<Author>Todd Wilbur</Author>
<Ingredients>6 medium tomatoes
10 jalapenos (red is best)
1/4 of a medium Spanish onion
2 cloves garlic
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
2 tablespoons white vinegar
2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 teaspoons mesquite-flavored liquid smoke</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Preheat your barbecue grill to high temperature.
2. Remove any stems from the tomatoes, then rub some oil over each tomato. You can leave the stems on the jalapenos.
3. Place the tomatoes on the grill when it’s hot. After about 10 minutes, place all of the jalapenos onto the grill. In about 10 minutes you can turn the tomatoes and the peppers. When almost the entire surface of the peppers has charred black you can remove them from the grill. The tomatoes will turn partially black, but when the skin begins to come off they are done. Put the peppers and tomatoes on a plate and let them cool.
4. When the tomatoes and peppers have cooled, remove most of the skin from the tomatoes and place them into a food processor. Pinch the stem end from each of the peppers and place them into the food processor as well. Toss out the liquid that remains on the plate.
5. Add the remaining ingredients to the food processor and puree on high speed for 5-10 seconds or until the mixture has a smooth consistency.
6. Place the salsa into a covered container and chill for several hours or overnight while the flavors develop.
Makes approximately 2 cups.</Instructions>
<Serves>0</Serves>
<Notes>Whip out the food processor and fire up the grill because you’ll need these essential tools to clone one of the best restaurant salsas in the business. The key to recreating the flavor of the real deal is to fire roast the tomatoes and the jalapenos, and to add a little mesquite-flavored liquid smoke. The restaurant chain uses a mesquite grill, so these steps are crucial to getting the same smoky flavor as the addictive restaurant version. Chevys uses chipotle peppers, or smoked red jalapeno peppers. But unless you grow your own jalapenos, it may be difficult to find the riper red variety in your local supermarket. For this recipe, the green jalapeno peppers will work fine. </Notes>

1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
dash chili powder

1 boneless chicken breast
1/3 cup sliced red bell pepper
1/3 cup sliced green bell pepper
1/3 cup sliced Spanish onion 
2 large (12-inch) fat-free flour tortillas
1 1/3 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese 


 

Mesquite Marinade 
1/2 cup water 
1 teaspoon mesquite-flavored liquid smoke 
1/2 teaspoon salt
dash ground black pepper

Spicy BBQ Sauce 
1/2 cup Bull&apos;s-Eye Original BBQ Sauce
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
dash chili powder

1 boneless chicken breast
1/3 cup sliced red bell pepper
1/3 cup sliced green bell pepper
1/3 cup sliced Spanish onion 
2 large (12-inch) fat-free flour tortillas
1 1/3 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Prepare the marinade by combining the ingredients in a medium bowl. Add chicken breast fillet to the bowl, cover, and chill for one hour. 
2. When the chicken is finished marinating, preheat your grill to high temperature. 
3. As grill is heating, prepare the spicy BBQ sauce by mixing the ingredients in a small bowl. 
4. Throw the chicken on the grill and cook it for 4 to 5 minutes per side or until it&apos;s done. When the chicken is done cooking, chop it into bite-size pieces. 
5. Spray a light coating of nonstick cooking spray on a medium skillet over medium heat. Sauté the sliced peppers and onion in the pan for 4 to 5 minutes or until the veggies start to brown. 
6. Set a large skillet over medium/low heat. 
7. Put one flour tortilla in the skillet and sprinkle 1/3 cup of cheese over half of the tortilla. Spoon half of the vegetables over the cheese, followed by half of the chicken. 
8. Spoon a generous portion of the spicy BBQ sauce over the chicken, followed by another 1/3 cup of cheese.
9. Fold the other side of the tortilla over the filling, and press down so that it stays in place.
10. By this time, the cheese on the bottom should be melted. If not, wait another minute or so, then flip the quesadilla over and heat for another couple minutes or until all of the cheese has melted.
11. Slide the quesadilla onto a plate and slice it into 4 pieces. Repeat for the second quesadilla and serve immediately with salsa on the side.

<Notes>With this secret recipe from the latest TSR low-lat book, it isn&apos;t necessary to cook the chicken over a mesquite grill as they do in the restaurant chain. Sure, you could get some mesquite wood chips and throw &apos;em on your barbecue or you can use that charcoal that has mesquite in it. But an easier way to get the flavor of mesquite--especially if all you&apos;ve got is a gas grill--is to soak the chicken in a marinade made with mesquite-flavored liquid smoke. In the restaurant these puppies are made with red chili tortillas. Since these type of tortillas can be a drag to track down, especially in fat-free versions, we&apos;ll use plain fat-free tortillas for our tasty reduced-fat clone.  </Notes>

<Ingredients>1 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1 egg
1 cup milk
2 chicken breast fillets
4-6 cups vegetable oil
1/4 cup Crystal or Frank&apos;s Louisiana hot sauce
1 tablespoon margarine

On the side
bleu cheese dressing (for dipping)
celery sticks </Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Combine flour, salt, peppers and paprika in a medium bowl.
2. In another small bowl, whisk together egg and milk.
3. Slice each chicken breast into 6 pieces. Preheat 4-6 cups of vegetable oil in a deep fryer to 375 degrees.
4. One or two at a time, dip each piece of chicken into the egg mixture, then into the breading blend; then repeat the process so that each piece of chicken is double-coated.
5. When all chicken pieces have been breaded, arrange them on a plate and chill for 15 minutes.
6. When the chicken is done resting, drop each piece into the hot oil and fry for 5-6 minutes or until each piece is browned.
7. As chicken fries, combine the hot sauce and margarine in a small bowl. Microwave sauce for 20-30 seconds or just until the margarine is melted, then stir to combine. You can also use a small saucepan for this step. Just combine the hot sauce and margarine in the saucepan over low heat and stir until margarine is melted and ingredients are blended.
8. When chicken pieces are done frying, remove them to a plate lined with a couple paper towels.
9. Place the chicken pieces into a covered container such as a large jar with a lid. Pour the sauce over the chicken in the container, cover, and then shake gently until each piece of chicken is coated with sauce. Pour the chicken onto a plate and serve the dish with bleu cheese dressing and sliced celery on the side. </Instructions>

10. Prepare the cinnamon butter by creaming together the butter, sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl with an electric mixer on high speed.
11. When you are ready to make your dessert, heat up a small skillet over medium heat. When the skillet is hot, remove it from the heat then add about 1 tablespoon of the cinnamon butter to the pan. It should quickly melt and sizzle. Slice the pie into 9 pieces and place one into the hot skillet. If the pie has cooled, you can reheat each slice by zapping it in the microwave for 30-40 seconds.
12. Place a scoop of ice cream on top of the pie. Drizzle chocolate and caramel syrup over the dessert and then sprinkle about 2 teaspoons of chopped walnuts over the top. Repeat for the remaining ingredients and serve sizzling in the skillet. </Instructions>
<Serves>9</Serves>
<Notes>What makes this dessert so special is the way it comes to your table sizzling in a cast iron skillet. Just like fajitas. The chocolate chip cookie and graham cracker crust &quot;pie&quot; is topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, and then drizzled with chocolate and caramel syrup. It&apos;s all served up in a hot skillet of cinnamon butter. Yum! If you want to prepare this one just like they do at the restaurant, you&apos;ll need one of those skillets for each serving. Small iron skillets work the best, but any 6 or 8-inch frying pan will do fine. You just have to be sure your pan is super hot to get that authentic Chili&apos;s &quot;sizzle.&quot; If you don&apos;t have enough of the right pans for each serving, you can slide it all onto a plate. It may not have the sizzle of the real thing, but it&apos;ll still taste awesome! </Notes>

<Ingredients>Pico de Gallo
2 medium tomatoes, diced
1/2 cup diced Spanish onion
2 teaspoons chopped fresh jalapeno pepper, seeded and de-ribbed
2 teaspoons finely minced fresh cilantro
Pinch of salt

Guacamole
2 small or 1 large Haas avocado
2 tablespoons sour cream
1/4 cup diced tomato
1/2 teaspoon diced jalapeno
1/4 teaspoon chopped fresh cilantro
1/4 teaspoon lemon juice
1/8 teaspoon salt

Chili Queso
3 ounces ground beef
1 teaspoon all-purpose flour
pinch of salt
pinch of ground black pepper
16-ounce bottle Cheez Whiz
2 tablespoons milk
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon paprika

2 pounds ground beef
4 large sesame seed buns
2 cups iceberg lettuce, shredded or chopped thin
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 green onion, chopped
16-20 tortilla chips
2-3 fresh jalapenos, sliced</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. First make the pico de gallo. This is easy. Just combine all of the ingredients for the pico in a small bowl and mix well. Cover bowl and chill in the refrigerator.
2. Now we&apos;ll make the guacamole. In a small bowl, smash up most of the avocado, but be sure to leave several unsmashed chunks. Add the remaining ingredients for the guacamole to the avocado and mix well. Cover bowl and chill in the refrigerator, next to the pico.
3. Next we&apos;ll make the chili queso. In yet another small bowl, mix together ground beef, flour, a pinch of salt, a pinch of black pepper, and a pinch of chili powder. Use your hands to work the dry ingredients into the ground beef. Brown the beef in a small skillet over medium heat for about 5 minutes. Use a spoon or spatula to crumble the beef as it cooks. Cook until it&apos;s brown, then set aside.
4. Melt the Cheez Whiz with 2 tablespoons of milk over low heat. When milk and cheese has been combined, add the remaining queso ingredients. Heat while stirring often until cheese is smooth and creamy, then cover saucepan and remove it from the heat.
5. Pre-heat a griddle or large frying pan over medium heat. Lightly butter the face of each bun and brown the buns face-down on the heat.
6. Separate the ground beef into four 1/2-pound portions. Roll each portion of meat into a ball and then pat the meat down into a circular patty slightly larger in diameter than the hamburger buns. Cook the hamburger patties for 5-10 minutes per side, until done. Lightly salt and pepper each burger patty.
7. Build the burger open-faced in the following order starting with the bottom bun:

On Bottom Bun
1/2 cup shredded lettuce
hamburger patty
2 tablespoons chili queso
4 or 5 crumbled tortilla chips
2 teaspoons green onion

On Top Bun
1/2 tablespoon mayonnaise
2 tablespoons pico de gallo
2 tablespoons guacamole
4 jalapeno slices

Serve burger with extra queso and guacamole. May also serve french fries on the side and use the chili queso for dipping.</Instructions>

<Ingredients>1 chicken breast fillet
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 tablespoons minced red bell pepper
2 tablespoons minced green onion
1/3 cup frozen corn
1/4 cup canned black beans, rinsed and drained
2 tablespoons frozen spinach, thawed and drained
2 tablespoons diced, canned jalapeno peppers
1/2 tablespoon minced fresh parsley
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
dash cayenne pepper
3/4 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
five 7-inch flour tortillas  

 

Avocado-ranch dipping sauce
1/4 cup smashed, fresh avocado (about half of an avocado)
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup sour cream
1 tablespoon buttermilk
1 1/2 teaspoons white vinegar
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon dried parsley
1/8 teaspoon onion powder
dash dried dill weed
dash garlic powder
dash pepper

Garnish
2 tablespoons chopped tomato
1 tablespoon chopped onion</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Preheat barbecue grill to high heat.
2. Rub the chicken breast with some vegetable oil then grill it on the barbecue for 4 to 5 minutes per side or until done. Lightly salt and pepper each side of the chicken while it cooks. Set chicken aside until it cools down enough to handle.
3. Preheat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a medium-size skillet over medium-high heat.
4. Add the red pepper and onion to the pan and sauté for a couple minutes until tender.
5. Dice the cooked chicken into small cubes and add it to the pan. Add the corn, black beans, spinach, jalapeno peppers, parsley, cumin, chili powder, salt, and cayenne pepper to the pan. Cook for another 4 minutes. Stir well so that the spinach separates and is incorporated into the mixture.
6. Remove the pan from the heat and add the cheese. Stir until the cheese is melted.
7. Wrap the tortillas in a moist cloth and microwave on high temperature for 1 1/2 minutes or until hot.
8. Spoon approximately one-fifth of the mixture into the center of a tortilla. Fold in the ends and then roll the tortilla over the mixture. Roll the tortilla very tight, then pierce with a toothpick to hold together. Repeat with the remaining ingredients until you have five eggrolls. Arrange the eggrolls on a plate, cover the plate with plastic wrap and freeze for at least 4 hours. Overnight is best.
9. While the eggrolls freeze prepare the avocado-ranch dipping sauce by combining all of the ingredients in a small bowl.
10. Preheat 4-6 cups of oil to 375 degrees.
11. Deep fry the eggrolls in the hot oil for 12-15 minutes and remove to paper towels or a rack to drain for about 2 minutes.
12. Slice each eggroll diagonally lengthwise and arrange on a plate around a small bowl of the dipping sauce. Garnish the dipping sauce with the chopped tomato and onion</Instructions>

<Notes>Many people have hopped on the cloning bandwagon for this recipe. Unfortunately the &quot;clone&quot; recipes that are floating around out there for this dish are pretty lame. So into the TSR test kitchen we go, and out comes the closest thing you&apos;ll ever savor next to actually eating the real thing. These &quot;eggrolls&quot; are made with flour tortillas, stuffed with a spicy blend of corn, green onions, black beans, spinach, jalapeno peppers, monterey jack cheese and spices. When you add the creamy avocado ranch dipping sauce, you&apos;re tastebuds will begin to party. Make these several hours before you plan to serve them so that they can freeze solid before frying. This will help to make the outside a dark golden brown, and the eggrolls will stay folded without letting any oil seep into the filling. This is how they cook &apos;em at the restaurant chain. And now you can check out the video for a hands-on demonstration.</Notes>

1 cup water
1/4 cup granulated sugar
3 cups crushed ice
1/3 cup frozen whole strawberries (about 4 large strawberries)
1/2 cup half-and-half
1/4 cup lemon juice
1/4 cup Hershey’s strawberry syrup
 

 

1. Combine the water and sugar in a cup and stir until the sugar is dissolved.
2. Add this sugar syrup to other ingredients in a blender. Blend on high speed until the drink is smooth. Serve in two 16-ounce glasses.
Makes 2 large drinks.

Orange
3 cups crushed ice
1 cup water
2/3 cup orange juice
1/2 cup half-and-half
3 tablespoons Tang orange drink mix

1. Mix all ingredients in a blender set on high speed until smooth and creamy. Serve in two 16-ounce glasses.
Makes 2 large drinks.

Mochalatta
3 cups crushed ice
1 1/2 cups TSR version of Mochalatta Chill
1/2 cup half-and-half
2 tablespoons chocolate syrup</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Mix all ingredients in a blender set on high speed until smooth and creamy. Serve in two 16-ounce glasses</Instructions>
<Serves>2</Serves>
<Notes>In a blender, Cinnabon adds concentrated flavoring, some ice and a curious secret ingredient referred to only as a &quot;dairy product.&quot; When blended smooth, out comes these thick, refreshing drinks that look and taste like they were made with ice cream. For this clone we just need a little half-and-half (that&apos;s half cream and half milk for those of you across the pond). It gives this version the exact same creamy consistency as the original with its custom &quot;dairy&quot; ingredient. Strawberry is the most popular of the flavors, but the other two are tasty as well. The Mochalatta version uses the TSR clone of the Mochalatta Chill from last week and produces as thicker blended version of the drink, similar to Starbuck&apos;s popular blended Frappuccino.

two 1 1/2-ounce Hershey milk chocolate bars
16 large marshmallows
2 tablespoons Hershey&apos;s chocolate syrup, in squirt bottle</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Preheat the broiler. Arrange the graham crackers side by side on an oven-safe plate (such as ceramic). You can also use a baking sheet.
2. Stack the milk chocolate bars side by side on top of the graham crackers.
3. Arrange the marshmallows on the chcocolate in 4 rows -- 4 across, 4 down.
4. Broil the dessert on the middle rack for 1 to 3 minutes or until the marshmallows turn light brown on top.
5. Remove the dessert from the oven. If you used a baking sheet, carefully slide the dessert onto a serving plate. With the squirt bottle, immediately drizzle the chocolate syrup over the marshmallows in a sweeping back-and-forth motion. Drizzle the chocolate diagonally across the dessert one way, and then the other, creating a cross-hatch pattern. Allow the chocolate to over-shoot the dessert so that it creates a decorative pattern on the serving plate as well. </Instructions>

<Ingredients>2 pounds russet potatoes
1 cup mayonnaise
4 teaspoons sweet pickle relish
4 teaspoons sugar
2 teaspoons minced white onion
2 teaspoons prepared mustard
1 teaspoon vinegar
1 teaspoon minced celery
1 teaspoon diced pimentos
1/2 teaspoon shredded carrot
1/4 teaspoon dried parsley
1/4 teaspoon pepper
dash salt</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Lightly peel the potatoes (you don&apos;t have to get all of the skin off) then chop them into bite-size pieces and boil in 6 cups of boiling, salted water for 7 to10 minutes. The potato chuncks should be tender, yet slightly tough in the middle when done. Drain and rinse potatoes with cold water.
2. In a medium bowl, combine remaining ingredients and whisk until smooth.
3. Poured drained potatoes into a large bowl. Pour the dressing over the potatoes and mix until well combined.
4. Cover and chill for at least 4 hours. Overnight is best.
Makes 6 cups </Instructions>
<Serves>8</Serves>
<Notes>Here&apos;s a simple clone for the potato salad that is purchased as a side dish from America&apos;s largest fast food chicken chain. Some of the skin is left on the potatoes in the real thing, so you don&apos;t have to peel them too thoroughly.  Just be sure to chop your potatoes into cubes that are approximately 1/2-inch thick, and then let the salad marinate for at least 4 hours so that the flavors can properly develop. If you let the salad chill overnight, it tastes even better. </Notes>

<Ingredients>Cookies
1 cup margarine
3/4 cup dark brown sugar
1/2 cup sugar
1 tablespoon molasses
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 eggs
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon cinnamon
1 1/2 cups 1-minute Quaker Oats

Creme Filling
2 teaspoons very hot water
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 cups marshmallow creme (1 7-ounce jar)
1/2 cup shortening
1/3 cup powdered sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. In a large bowl, cream together margarine, sugars, molasses, vanilla, and eggs.
3. In a separate bowl combine the flour, salt, baking soda, and cinnamon.
4. Combine the dry ingredients with the wet ingredients. Mix in the oats.
5. Drop dough by tablespoonfuls onto an ungreased baking sheet. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until cookies are just starting to darken around the edges. They will still appear moist in the center. Be careful not to overcook - when cooled, the cookies should be soft and chewy.
6. While the cookies bake, prepare the filling. Use a small bowl to dissolve the salt in 2 teaspoons of very hot water. Set this solution aside to cool.
7. Combine the marshmallow creme, shortening, powdered sugar, and vanilla in a medium bowl and mix well with an electric mixer on high speed until fluffy. Add the cooled salt solution to the filling mixture and combine with the mixer.
8. Assemble each creme pie by spreading the filling over one side of a cookie (the flat side) and press another cookie on top, making a sandwich. Repeat for the remaining cookies and filling.

Makes 2 dozen creme pies.</Instructions>

<Notes>These soft, creme-filled sandwich cookies were the first snacks produced by McKee Foods back in 1960.  It was his 4-year old granddaughter Debbie after which founder O.D. McKee named his line of snack cakes.  O.D. was inspired by a picture of the little girl in play clothes and a straw hat, and that&apos;s the image we still find today on every package.  The secret to cloning these mouth-watering snacks is re-creating the soft, chewy consistency of the oatmeal cookies.  To duplicate the texture, the cookies are slightly underbaked.  Then you whip up some of the easy-to-make creme filling with marshmallow creme and spread it between two of the oatmeal cookies to complete the sandwich.  Next stop, yum city!</Notes>

<Ingredients>4 garnet yams
3 tablespoons granulated sugar 
1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon 
1/2 cup whipped butter </Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Bake yams for 45 to 75 minutes (bigger yams take longer to cook). When they are done, the outside will have darkened and the inside will be soft. You may see liquid from the potato oozing out and charring. When the potato is sliced open, the inside of the skin will be charred black from the caramelizing sugar in the potato. This is a perfectly cooked potato. 
3. To serve, slice a potato down the center. Add two tablespoons of whipped butter, then sprinkle some cinnamon/sugar over the top</Instructions>
<Serves>4</Serves>
<Notes>It saddles on up next to your entree at this huge steakhouse chain, but it&apos;s not what it claims to be. Sure, the menu says &quot;baked sweet potato,&quot; but you&apos;re actually getting a sweet and tender red-skinned yam underneath all that yummy melted butter and cinnamon/sugar. And don&apos;t just get any yam for this top secret clone. You want to use garnet yams, if you have a choice. Then be sure to cook them long enough that the sugar in the yams begins to squirt out and burn in a couple of spots. Each yam should be tender, but not mushy. The skin on the outside will turn from red to greyish-brown, and inside it will be a hearty shade of black. </Notes>

1 head iceberg lettuce
1 cup crumbled bleu cheese
1 cup diced tomato (1 large tomato) </Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Use an electric mixer to combine all ingredients for bleu cheese dressing in a medium bowl. 
2. Slice a head of iceberg lettuce into quarters through the stem end. Cut the stem off of the wedges and arrange each one on a plate.
3. Spoon about 1/4 cup of bleu cheese dressing over each lettuce wedge. 
4. Sprinkle 1/4 cup of crumbled bleu cheese over the dressing.
5. Sprinkle 1/4 cup of diced tomato over the top and serve.</Instructions>

<Notes>Why waste time chopping up the lettuce when you can just hack a head into four chunks, dress it up and serve? This unique presentation is not only easy to make, but also a deliciously different way to serve your next salad. The creamy bleu cheese dressing is a cinch to make from scratch and tastes much better than anything you&apos;ll buy in a store.

<Author>http://www.topsecretrecipes.com</Author>
<Ingredients>1 tablespoon mayonnaise
1/2 teaspoon brown mustard (French&apos;s &quot;Hearty Deli&quot; is good)
1 sesame seed hamburger bun
1/4 pound ground beef
1 slice American cheese
1 to 2 tomato slices
1 to 2 lettuce leaves, chopped
1/2 tablespoon ketchup
2 tablespoons chopped onion</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. In a small bowl, mix together the mayonnaise and the brown mustard. Set aside.
2. Grill the face of each of the buns on a griddle or frying pan over medium heat.
3. Roll the ground beef into a ball and pat it out until it&apos;s approximately the same diameter as the bun. 
4. Cook meat on hot griddle or frying pan for about 5 minutes per side or until done. Be sure to lightly salt and pepper each side of the patty.
5. Build the burger in the following order, from the bottom up:

On Bottom Bun
beef patty
American cheese slice
1 to 2 tomato slices
lettuce

On Top Bun
mayo/mustard
ketchup
onions

6. Slap the top onto the bottom and serve hot.

Tidbits:
If you can find thick-sliced pepper bacon in your supermarket, you can add it to the burger just as you could at the restaurant chain. Cut one slice in half after cooking and place the slices next to each other onto the bottom bun before adding the beef patty.

<Notes>In 1996, McDonald&apos;s set out to target more educated tastebuds in a massive advertising campaign for its newest burger creation. We watched while Ronald McDonald golfed, danced, and leisurely hung out with real-life grown-up humans, instead of the puffy Mayor McCheese and that bunch of wacko puppets. Supposedly the Arch Deluxe, with the &quot;Adult Taste&quot;,  would appeal to those dancers and golfers and anyone else with a sophisticated palate. But let&apos;s face it, we&apos;re not talking Beef Wellington here. The Arch Deluxe is just a hamburger, after all, with only a couple of elements that set it apart from the other menu items. The big difference is the creamy brown mustard spread on the sandwich right next to the ketchup. And the burger is assembled on a sesame seed potato roll (which actually tastes very much like your common hamburger bun). Also, you can order the burger with the optional thick-sliced peppered bacon, for an extra ka-ching. Okay, so the plan hasn&apos;t quite worked out the way Micky D&apos;s had hoped. Sales of the Arch Deluxe have been disappointing, to say the least. That&apos;s why I thought this would be a good recipe to clone.  You know, for all of you who have been struggling to get by without the Arch Deluxe in your lives. The Arch Deluxe may have gone on to join the McD.L.T and the McLean Deluxe on the great list of fast food duds from our past.  But you can now create a delicious kitchen facsimile of your own with this recipe.  And hopefully, in the meantime, Ronald has gone back to work.

<Notes>If you like Big Macs, it&apos;s probably because of that tasty &quot;secret&quot; spread that is plopped onto both decks of the world&apos;s most popular double-decker hamburger. So what&apos;s so special about this sauce? After all, it&apos;s basically just thousand island dressing, right? Pretty much. But this sauce has a bit more sweet pickle relish in it than a typical thousand island salad slather. Also, I found that this clone comes close to the original with the inclusion of French dressing. It&apos;s an important ingredient - ketchup just won&apos;t do it. That, along with a sweet &amp; sour flavor that comes from vinegar and sugar, makes this sauce go well on any of your home burger creations, whether they&apos;re Big Mac clones or not.

ground black pepper
2 teaspoons ketchup
1 tablespoon mayonnaise
1 tablespoon chopped onion
3 pickle slices (hamburger style)
1/2 cup chopped lettuce
1 large tomato slice
non-stick cooking spray</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Form the ground beef into a very large patty on wax paper. Make it approximately 5 1/2 to 6 inches in diameter (the meat should shrink to the perfect size for the buns when cooked). Freeze this patty for a couple hours before cooking.
2. Grill the faces of the hamburger bun in a hot skillet over medium heat. Grill until the buns are golden brown. Leave pan hot.
3. Grill the frozen patty in the pan for 2 to 3 minutes per side. Sprinkle one side with seasoned salt and ground black pepper.
4. Prepare the rest of the burger by first spreading the 2 teaspoons of ketchup on the face of the top bun. Follow the ketchup with the tablespoon of mayonnaise.
5. Stack the onion onto the top bun next, followed by the pickles and lettuce. Add the tomato slice to the top of the stack.
6. When the beef patty is done cooking, use a spatula to arrange it on the bottom bun. Turn the top of the burger over onto the bottom and serve. </Instructions>

<Notes>McDonald&apos;s roll-out of the BigXtra! is another bomb dropped on the battlefield of the latest burger war.  Burger King took the first shot by introducing the Big King - a pretty good clone of McDonald&apos;s signature Big Mac, with a bit more meat and no middle bun.  Then Mickey D&apos;s fired back with a clone of Burger King&apos;s popular Whopper, to be exact.  That&apos;s just under 5 ounces of ground beef, stacked on a huge sesame seed bun, with the same ingredients you would find piled on the Whopper - lettuce, onion, tomato, ketchup, mayo, and pickles.  Plus McDonald&apos;s addition of a special spice sprinkled on the beef as it cooks.  It&apos;s all very tasty.  Especially if you like Whoppers.  Today the Big Xtra! is less extra, having been shrunk down and renamed Big &apos;N Tasty.</Notes>

<Notes>It was in the late seventies, shortly after McDonald&apos;s had introduced the Egg McMuffin, that the food giant realized the potential of a quick, drive-thru breakfast. Soon, the company had developed several breakfast selections, including the Big Breakfast with eggs, hash browns, and sausage. Eventually one out of every four breakfasts eaten on the go would be served at McDonald&apos;s - an impressive statistic indeed.

2 10-ounce boxes sliced strawberries with sugar added, thawed 
1/3 cup frozen blueberries, thawed  
1/2 cup crunchy, sweet granola </Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Pour 1/2 cup of yogurt into a parfait cup or tall glass.

<Serves>4</Serves>
<Notes>This one&apos;s super easy to make, plus it&apos;s low fat and delicious. The yogurt in the original is very sweet and creamy, like Yoplait. So that&apos;s the brand that you should use, although any brand of vanilla yogurt will work fine. If you use Yoplait, you&apos;ll need two 6-ounce containers of the stuff per serving. For the granola, just look for one that contains mostly oats. It should be crunchy and sweet (such as &quot;maple&quot; flavor) and can also include puffed rice bits. You can even make these a day or two ahead of time. Keep them covered in the fridge, and hold off on the granola topping until you serve &apos;em up or it&apos;ll get mighty soggy. </Notes>

<Notes>You might not imagine a tough World War II flying ace would open a restaurant called &quot;Mimi&apos;s,&quot; but that&apos;s exactly what happened in the 70&apos;s. Arthur J. Simms flew spy missions over France during the war and helped liberate a small French town near Versailles. After the war Arthur ran the commissary at MGM studios in Hollywood, stuffing the bellies of big-time celebs like Judy Garland, Clark Gable and Mickey Rooney. He later joined his son Tom in several restaurant ventures including one called &quot;French Quarter&quot; in West Hollywood. This was the prototype for the French-themed Mimi&apos;s Cafe. In 1978, the first Mimi&apos;s opened in Anaheim, California. Today there&apos;s over 40 Mimi&apos;s in the chain with a new one opening every other week; all of them serving this amazing onion soup that can now be part of your culinary repertoire.

The wafers were being whipped up from scratch at home long before Nabisco introduced the lightweight, poker chip-like packaged cookies in 1945.  Back then they were called Vanilla Wafers.  But in the 60s Nabisco slapped the trade name Nilla Wafers on the box.  Today the real things come about 100 to a box and really fly when whipped into the air with a little flick of the wrist.  Here now, you can relive the days of old with a homemade version fresh out of the oven.  This clone recipe makes about half a box&apos;s worth and they fly just as far</Notes>

<Notes>It&apos;s amazing how many lousy clones for this delicious chili-like soup from Olive Garden are floating around on the Web. Some are shared on message boards, others are displayed on sites in a collection of &quot;actual restaurant recipes&quot; (yeah, right!).

<Name>Honey Wheat Bushman Bread®</Name>
<Author>http://www.topsecretrecipes.com</Author>
<Ingredients>Dough
1 1/2 cups warm water
2 tablespoons butter, softened
1/2 cup honey
2 cups bread flour
1 2/3 cups wheat flour
1 tablespoon cocoa
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
2 teaspoons instant coffee
1 teaspoon salt
2 1/4 teaspoons (1 pkg.) yeast

Coloring
1/4 cup water
75 drops red food coloring
45 drops blue food coloring
30 drops yellow food coloring

cornmeal for dusting</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. If using a bread machine, add all of the ingredients for the dough in the exact order listed into the pan of your machine. Set it on &quot;knead&quot; and when the machine begins to mix the dough, combine the food coloring with 1/4 cup of water and drizzle it into the mixture as it combines. After the dough is created let it rest to rise for an hour or so. Then remove it from the pan and go to step #3.
2. If you are not using a bread machine, combine the flours, cocoa, sugar, coffee and salt in large bowl. Make a depression or &quot;well&quot; in the middle of the dry mixture. Pour the warm water into this &quot;well,&quot; then add the butter, honey and yeast. Combine the food coloring drops with 1/4 cup of water and add that to the &quot;well.&quot; Slowly mix the ingredients with a spoon, drawing the dry ingredients into the wet. When you can handle the dough, begin to combine it by hand, kneading the dough thoroughly for at least ten minutes, until it is very smooth and has a consistent color. Set the dough into a covered bowl in a warm place for an hour, to allow it to rise.
3. When the dough has risen to about double in size, punch it down and divide it into 8 even portions (divide dough in half, divide those halves in half, and then once more). Form the portions into tubular shaped loaves about 8 inches long and 2 inches wide. Sprinkle the entire surface of the loaves with cornmeal and place them on a cookie sheet, or two. Cover the cookie sheet(s) with plastic wrap and let the dough rise once more for another hour in a warm location.
4. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Uncover the dough and bake it for 20-24 minutes in the hot oven. Loaves should begin to darken slightly on top when done. Serve warm with a sharp bread knife and butter on the side. If you want whipped butter, like you get at the restaurant, just use an electric mixer on high speed to whip some butter until it&apos;s fluffy.

Tidbits
It is normal for this dough to be a bit tacky and to seem somewhat thin. Just be sure to add plenty of flour to your hands and work surface when working with the dough to prevent sticking.
If you are able to find caramel color, you can use that with 1/4 cup of water in place of the food coloring formula described in the recipe. </Instructions>
<Serves>8</Serves>
<Notes>Along with an entree at this popular steakhouse chain, comes a freshly baked loaf of this dark, sweet bread, served on it&apos;s own cutting board with soft whipped butter. One distinctive feature of the bread is its color. How does the bread get so dark? While you may notice the recipe includes instant coffee and cocoa, these ingredients will not give it it&apos;s deep dark chocolate brown color - not even close. Usually breads that are this dark -- such as pumpernickel or dark bran muffins -- contain caramel color, an ingredient often used in the industry to darken foods. Since your local supermarket will not likely have this mostly commercial product, we will make the caramel color from a mixture of three food colorings -- red, yellow and blue. Just be sure to get the food coloring in the little droppers so that you can count the drops as you measure. That&apos;s very important to getting the color just right. You may also opt to keep the color out. The bread will certainly taste the same, but will look nothing like the real deal. I suggest using a bread machine for the mixing and kneading, if you have one.</Notes>

<Ingredients>Candied Pecans 
1/2 cup granulated sugar 
2 tablespoons water 
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 
1 teaspoon butter
1 1/4 cups chopped pecans

Cinnamon Croutons
2 cups cubed Bushman Bread (from clone here --
    or you can use another sweet bread such as 
    Hawaiian Sweet Bread or Pillsbury Honey White Bread.)
1/3 cup salted butter 
2 tablespoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon

Cinnamon Apples
1 20-ounce can apple pie filling
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1 tablespoon brown sugar

4 cups vanilla ice cream
1/2 cup caramel topping (Smucker&apos;s is good) 
1 1/2 cups whipped cream 
4 fresh strawberries</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. For candied pecans, combine 1/2 cup granulated sugar, 2 tablespoons water, 1 teaspoon butter, and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon in a small saucepan over medium heat. Heat until mixture boils and all sugar granules are dissolved. 
2. Add chopped pecans to mixture and stir for 1 to 2 minutes over heat. Be sure that all pecans are well-coated.
3. Pour mixture onto a large plate and continue to stir until mixture hardens and begins to break up. You should be able to separate all of the nuts. 
4. For the croutons, preheat the oven to 300 degrees. Pour the slice bread cubes onto an ungreased cookie sheet and bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until the bread has turned light brown. Stir halfway through cooking time. 
5. Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Pour baked croutons into the pan and sauté until the bread is well-coated with butter. Combine the 2 tablespoons of sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon in a small bowl. Sprinkle this mixture over the croutons while stirring so that the croutons are well-coated with cinnamon/sugar. Remove croutons from the heat and pour them onto a plate to cool. 
6. Prepare apples by carefully mixing them with 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon and 1 tablespoon of brown sugar in a large bowl. You want to be sure you don&apos;t stir hard enough to break up the apples. Microwave the apple for 1 to 2 minutes or until hot.
7. To assemble the dessert for serving, first roll four cup-size scoops of ice cream in the pecan pieces. You can do this step ahead of time if you like, keeping the pecan-covered scoops in your freezer. 
8. Place an ice cream scoop onto a small plate, then pour about a tablespoon of caramel over the ice cream. Dribble another tablespoon around the base of the ice cream onto the plate.
9. Spread the hot apples around the base of the ice cream being sure to divide them evenly amongst the four servings.
10. Divide the croutons into four portions and sprinkle them on the apples around the base of the ice cream scoop on each plate.
11. Spread a generous portion of whipped cream onto the top of each scoop of ice cream.
12. Top off each dish with a fresh strawberry.</Instructions>

<Instructions>1. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.
2. Spread the coconut over the bottom of the inside of a large oven pan. Shake the pan a little to spread the coconut evenly.
3. Bake the coconut for 25-30 minutes or until the coconut is a light, golden brown. You may have to stir or shake the coconut in the last 10 minutes to help it brown evenly.
4. When the coconut has cooled, pour it onto a plate, or into a large bowl. Roll each scoop of ice cream in the coconut until it is well coated. Press down on the ice cream to help the coconut stick. Put the ice cream into four separate bowls.
5. Heat up the chocolate syrup for 10-15 seconds in the microwave. Pour about two tablespoons over each scoop of ice cream. Try to completely cover the ice cream with chocolate.
6. Spray some whipped cream on the top of each scoop of ice cream.
7. Cut the stems from the strawberries and place one on each serving; upside down on the whipped cream. Serve with a spoon. </Instructions>

<Instructions>1. Combine all of the sauce ingredients - except the cornstarch, arrowroot, and 3 tablespoons of water - in a small saucepan over high heat. Stir often while bringing mixture to a boil. When sauce reaches a boil, remove it from heat and allow it to cool a bit, uncovered.
2. Slice chicken breasts into bite-size chunks. Remove exactly 1 cup of the marinade from the pan and pour it over the chicken in a large resealable plastic bag or other container which allows the chicken to be completely covered with the marinade. The chicken should marinate for at least a couple hours. Cover the remaining sauce and leave it to cool until the chicken is ready.
3. When chicken has marinated, preheat 2 inches of vegetable oil in a wok or skillet to 350 degrees.
4. Combine cornstarch with arrowroot in a small bowl, then add 3 tablespoons of water. Stir until cornstarch and arrowroot have dissolved. Pour this mixture into the sauce and set the pan over high heat. When sauce begins to bubble and thicken, cover and remove it from heat.
5. Beat together the ice water and egg in a medium bowl. Add baking soda and salt.
6. Add 3/4 cup of the flour and stir with a fork just until the flour in blended into the mixture. The batter should still be lumpy.
7. Sprinkle another 1/4 cup of flour on top of the batter and mix with only one or two strokes. Most of the new flour will still floating on top of the mixture. Put the remaining flour (1/2 cup) into a separate medium bowl.
8. Dip each piece of chicken first into the flour, then into the batter. Let some of the batter drip off and then slide the chicken into the oil. Fry up to 1/2 of the chicken pieces at a time for 3 to 4 minutes, or until golden brown. Flip the chicken over halfway through the cooking time. Remove the chicken to a rack or paper towels to drain.
9. As the chicken cooks, reheat the sauce left covered on the stove. Stir occasionally.
10. When all of the chicken is done, pour it into a large bowl, and cover with the thickened sauce. Stir gently until all of the pieces are well coated. </Instructions>

<Notes>As far as Chinese food goes, I think the stuff these guys throw together in sizzling woks is surprisingly tasty for a takeout chain.  This dish is something of a twist on the traditional sweet and sour chicken commonly found at Chinese restaurants over the years.  This popular menu item has a delicious, citrus-laced, tangy-sweet sauce with a spicy nip the regulars find truly addictive.  The chain claims to cook all of its food in woks, including sauces.  But this homegrown version will work fine, whether you go for a wok, or not.</Notes>

<Notes>John Schnatter was only 23 years old when he used 1600 dollars of start-up money to buy a pizza oven and have it installed in the broom closet of an Indiana tavern. John started delivering his hot, fresh pizzas, and in 1984, the first year of his business, he sold 300 to 400 pizzas a week. One year later, he opened the first Papa John&apos;s restaurant, and has become an American success story. Today the company has expanded to over 2600 locations in 49 states and has revenues of 1.7 billion dollars a year. That puts John&apos;s business in the top three of all restaurant chains in overall sales growth, and the country&apos;s fastest growing pizza chain.

     John has kept the Papa John&apos;s menu simple. You won&apos;t find salads or subs or chicken wings on his menu. The company just sells pizza, with side orders of breadsticks and cheesesticks made from the same pizza dough recipe. With each order of breadsticks or cheesesticks comes your choice of dipping sauces. I&apos;ve got clones here for all three of those tasty sauces. You can use these easy clones as dips for a variety of products, or you can simply make your own breadsticks by baking your favorite pizza dough, then slicing it into sticks. If you want cheesesticks, just brush some of the Garlic Sauce on the dough, then sprinkle with mozzarella cheese and bake. Slice the baked dough into sticks and use the dipping sauce of your choice. It&apos;s a cinch.</Notes>

<RecipeType>Candy</RecipeType>
<Name>PayDay®Candy Bar</Name>
<Author>www.topsecretrecipes.com</Author>
<Ingredients>Centers
1/4 cup whole milk
5 unwrapped caramels
1 tablespoon light corn syrup
1 teaspoon peanut butter
1/4 teaspoon vanilla
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 cups powdered sugar

20 unwrapped caramels 
1 1/2 teaspoons water
2 cups dry roasted peanuts</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Combine all ingredients for the centers, except the powdered sugar, in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir often as the caramel slowly melts. When the mixture is smooth, add 3/4 cup of powdered sugar. Stir. Save the remaining 1/2 cup of powdered sugar for later. 
2. Use a candy thermometer to bring the mixture to exactly 230 degrees, stirring often, then turn off the heat.
3. When the temperature of the candy begins to drop, add the remaining 1/2 cup powdered sugar to the pan, then use a hand mixer on high speed to combine. Keep mixing until the candy cools and thickens and can no longer be mixed. That should take a minute or two.
4. Let the candy cool in the pan for 10 to 15 minutes, or until it can be touched. Don&apos;t let it sit too long - you want the candy to still be warm and pliable when you shape it. Take a tablespoon-size portion and roll it between your palms or on a countertop until it forms a roll the width of your index finger, and measuring about 4 1/2 inches long. Repeat with the remaining center candy mixture and place the rolls on wax paper. You should have 8 rolls. Let the center rolls sit out for an hour or two to firm up.   
5. Combine the 20 caramels with the 1 1/2 teaspoons of water in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir often until the caramels melt completely, then turn off the heat. If you work fast this caramel will stay warm while you make the candy bars.
6. Pour the peanuts onto a baking sheet or other flat surface. Using a basting brush and working quickly, &quot;paint&quot; a coating of caramel onto one side of a center roll. Quickly turn the center over, caramel-side-down, onto the peanuts and press gently so that the peanuts stick to the surface of the candy. Paint more caramel onto the other side of the roll and press it down onto the peanuts. The candy should have a solid layer of peanuts covering all sides. If needed, brush additional caramel onto the roll, then turn it onto the peanuts to coat the roll completely. Place the candy bar onto wax paper, and repeat with the remaining ingredients. Eat when completely cool. </Instructions>

<Notes>In December of 1996, Hershey Foods snagged the U.S. operations of Leaf Brands for a pretty penny. This added several well known candies to Hershey&apos;s already impressive roster, including Good &amp; Plenty, Jolly Rancher, Milk Duds, Whoppers, Heath, and this delicious peanut roll, which we can finally clone at home. The center is sort of a white fudge that we can make by combining a few ingredients on the stove, then getting the mixture up to just the right temperature using a candy thermometer (you&apos;ve got one, right?). Once cool, this candy center is coated with a thin layer of caramel, then quickly pressed onto roasted peanuts. Looks just like the real thing! This recipe will make eight candy bars. But it&apos;s up to you to make the dental appointment. </Notes>

<Name>Pot Stickers </Name>
<Author>http://www.topsecretrecipes.com</Author>
<Ingredients>1/4 pound ground turkey
1/2 teaspoon minced fresh ginger
1 teaspoon minced green onion
1 teaspoon minced water chestnuts
1/2 teaspoon soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (no seeds)
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
1 egg, beaten
Vegetable oil for frying
12 wonton wrappers (3 x 3-inch size) 

On the side
Hoisin sauce</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. In a small bowl, combine all the ingredients except the egg, wrappers and oil. Add 1 tablespoon of the beaten egg. Save the rest of the egg for later. Preheat oil in a deep fryer or a deep saucepan to 375 degrees. Use enough oil to cover the pot stickers -- 1 to 2 inches should be enough. 
2. Invert a small bowl or glass with a 3-inch diameter on the center of a wonton wrapper and cut around it to make a circle. Repeat for the remaining wrappers. 
3. Spoon 1/2 tablespoon of the turkey filling into the center of one wrapper. Brush a little beaten egg around half of the edge of the wrapper and fold the wrapper over the filling. Gather the wrapper as you seal it so that it is crinkled around the edge. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. 
4. Deep-fry the pot stickers, six at a time in the hot oil for 3 to 5 minutes or until they are brown. Drain on a rack or paper towels. Serve with hoisin sauce for dipping. If you want some crushed red pepper or cayenne pepper to the sauce.

Tidbits
If you can&apos;t find wonton wrappers, you can also use eggroll wrappers for this recipe. Eggroll wrappers are much bigger, so you will be wasting more of the dough when you trim the wrappers to 3-inch diameter circles. But in a pinch, this is a quick solution.
Pot sticker wrappers can also be found in some supermarkets, but I&apos;ve found the wonton wrappers and eggroll wrappers, when fried, taste more like the restaurant version.

<Notes>Menu Description: &quot;Six pot stickers filled with fresh ground turkey meat
seasoned with ginger, water chestnuts, red pepper and green onions.
They are fried and served in a basket with spicy hoisin.&quot; 

     Here&apos;s a special recipe from one of the most popular theme restaurant chains. Pot stickers are a popular Asian dumpling that can be fried, steamed, or simmered in a broth. Planet Hollywood has customized its version to make them crunchier than the traditional dish, and it&apos;s a tasty twist that I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll love. Since hoisin sauce would be very difficult to make from scratch, you can use a commercial brand found in most stores. </Notes>

<Name>Bacon-Wrapped Stuffed Shrimp</Name>
<Author>http://www.topsecretrecipes.com</Author>
<Ingredients>Seasoning
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon paprika
dash ground black pepper
dash cayenne pepper
dash allspice

Dipping Sauce
1/3 cup ranch dressing
1/4 teaspoon dried cilantro 
     (or 1/2 teaspoon fresh minced cilantro) 

5 pieces bacon
5 large shrimp 
3 slices fresh jalapeno 
1 ounce pepper jack cheese</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Preheat oven to broil.
2. Make the seasoning blend by combining the ingredients in a small bowl. Set this aside.
3. Make the dipping sauce by combining the ranch dressing with cilantro in a medium bowl.
4. Cook the bacon in a frying pan over medium/high heat, but don&apos;t cook it all the way to crispy. You want undercooked bacon that, when cool, will easily wrap around the shrimp. Cook the bacon about 3 minutes per side, and don&apos;t let it brown. When the bacon is done lay it on paper towels to drain and cool.
5. Shell the shrimp, leaving the last segment of the shell and the tail. Remove the dark vein from the back of the shrimp, and then cut down into the back of the shrimp, without cutting all the way through, so that the shrimp is nearly butterflied open. This will make a pocket for the pepper and cheese.
6. Pour 1 cup of water into a small bowl. Add the shrimp and jalapeno peppers and microwave for 60 to 90 seconds. Shrimp should be starting to firm up and change color. Immediately pour the water out of the bowl, remove the jalapeno slices and pour cold water over the shrimp. Place the the shrimp and jalapeno pepper slices onto paper towels to drain off excess water. 
7. Build the appetizer by cutting the jalapeno slices in half and removing the seeds. You should now have 6 jalapeno slices -- you&apos;ll need 5 of these. Place one slice into the slit on the back of a shrimp. Cut an inch-long chunk of cheese (about 1/4-inch thick), and place it on the jalapeno slice. Wrap a piece of bacon around the shrimp, starting where the cheese is. Start wrapping with the thinnest end of the bacon. Go 1 1/2 times around the shrimp and then cut of the excess bacon and slide a skewer through the shrimp, starting with the end where the cheese is and piercing the cut end of the bacon on the other side. Repeat with the remaining shrimp and slide them onto the skewer with the tails facing the same direction.   
8. Put the skewer onto a baking sheet or broiler pan and sprinkle a very light coating of the seasoning blend over the shrimp, then broil for 3 to 4 minutes or until the bacon begins to brown and the cheese begins to ooze. Serve over a bed of rice if desired. Feed the left over bacon pieces to the dog while you scarf out on the shrimp.</Instructions>

<Author>http://www.topsecretrecipes.com</Author>
<Ingredients>12 paper muffin cups
One 12-ounce pkg. milk chocolate chips
1 cup reduced-fat peanut butter 
1/2 cup powdered sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Cut the top half off of the muffin cups so that they are shallower.
2. Pour the chocolate chips into a glass bowl and melt them in the microwave: Microwave at 50% power for 2 minutes. Stir the chips gently, and let them sit for a minute or so. If the chocolate needs more melting, microwave those chippies again at half power for 30 seconds. Stir gently. Continue the process, stirring gently as you go. But be very careful not to overcook the chocolate or it&apos;ll seize up on you like day old Carolina roof tar. 
3. Using a teaspoon, spoon a portion of the chocolate into the middle of a muffin cup. Draw the chocolate up the edges of the cup with the back of the spoon. Coat the entire inside of the muffin cup with chocolate and place it into a muffin tin. Repeat with the remaining muffin cups and then put the whole muffin tin in the fridge so that the chocolate hardens.
4. Combine the reduced-fat peanut butter, powdered sugar and salt in a medium bowl.
5. When the chocolate in the muffin cups has hardened, pop the sweetened peanut butter into the microwave oven on full power for 1 minute. This will soften up the peanut butter so that it easily flows into the cups.
6. Spoon a small portion of peanut butter into each of the chocolate-coated cups. Leave room at the top for an additional layer of chocolate, which we&apos;ll add later. Pop the candy back in the refrigerator to harden the peanut butter. This should take an hour or so.
7. When the peanut butter filling has hardened, re-melt the chocolate chips in the microwave on half power for 30 to 60 seconds. Use a teaspoon to spread a layer of chocolate over the top of each candy. Chill the candy once again to set up the chocolate.
8. Finally, remember to take the paper off the outside of the peanut butter cups before eating them. </Instructions>

<Notes>The first Top Secret Recipes book features a version of this clone recipe for America&apos;s most beloved candy creation. That recipe now sits in just about every collection of &quot;copycat&quot; recipes passed around the Web. But since 1993, I&apos;ve learned a few things about the delicate science of Reese&apos;s Peanut Butter Cup cloning. You know, stuff like: &quot;Never clone peanut butter cups while crossing a busy intersection,&quot; and &quot;Don&apos;t clone peanut butter cups while under a tall tree in the rain.&quot; These are the sort of handy tips that you don&apos;t find anywhere else on the Internet. These are the things that come with experience, perseverance and a long, complicated thought process. Over seven years have passed, and I figured perhaps it was time to share some of the more useful of these discoveries with all you great folks here on the site. Now when you make your Reese&apos;s clones, you&apos;ll know to use reduced-fat peanut butter for a better texture. Now when you&apos;re craving that delicate combination of flavors, you&apos;ll know to get out the scissors to trim muffin cups for the chocolate. This is the improved recipe right here, authorized, and in its entirety! Now you can forget all about that other Reese&apos;s clone formula.

That&apos;s how you make the dough! One of the all-time favorites you can snag at any of the 364 Great American Cookies outlets is this clone of the classic snickerdoodle. Rolled in cinnamon and sugar, it&apos;s soft and chewy like the other cookies, and will seem to be undercooked when you take it out of the oven. When it cools it should be gooey, yet firm in the middle. And a couple bites will make you wonder: &quot;Got milk?!&quot; </Notes>

<Notes>Here&apos;s the signature drink from the chain that&apos;s reviving the drive-up burger joint, just like a scene out of American Graffiti or Happy Days. It was in 1953 that Troy Smith obtained the parcel of land in Shawnee, Oklahoma that was big enough to fit the new steakhouse and root beer stand that was his dream. Troy thought he&apos;d make he steakhouse his primary operation, but as it turned out folks preferred the hot dogs and cold drinks over at the root beer stand. So Troy did the smart thing and ditched the steakhouse to focus all his efforts on the other joint. At first he called the root beer stand &quot;Top Hat,&quot; but when Troy found out later that name was already being used, he came up &quot;Sonic&quot; to signify &quot;service at the speed of sound.&quot; Today the chain is the sixth largest hamburger outlet in the country. 
     This recipe makes a simple, old-fashioned drink by combining Sprite with cherry juice and some lime wedges. Use cherry juice made by Libby under the brand-name Juicy Juice for the best home clone.</Notes>

<Notes>Any Sonic Drive-In regular knows the three or four unique fountain drink favorites on the menu. There&apos;s the Limeade, the Diet Limeade, and, of course, the Cherry Limeade. But that bright blue stuff called Ocean Water has become a recent favorite for anyone who digs the taste of coconut - it&apos;s like a pina colda soda. The server simply squirts a bit of blue coconut syrup into some cold Sprite. The big secret to duplicating this one at home is re-creating that syrup, so that&apos;s the first step. After that&apos;s done, you make the drink as they do at the restaurant in less time than it takes to say, &quot;Does my blue tongue clash with what I&apos;m wearing?&quot;</Notes>

<Ingredients>4 quarts water (16 cups)
6 cups chicken stock
2 potatoes, peeled &amp; sliced
2 carrots, peeled &amp; sliced
2 stalks celery, with tops
2 cups peeled &amp; diced eggplant (about 1/2 of an eggplant)
1 medium onion, chopped

1/4 cup butter
3 tablespoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon curry powder
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/4 teaspoon thyme
1 bay leaf
dash marjoram
dash nutmeg</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Combine all ingredients in a large pot over high heat.
2. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 4-5 hours or until soup has reduced by more than half, and is thick and brownish in color. It should have the consistency of chili. Stir occasionally for the first few hours, but stir often in the last hour. The edges of the potatoes should become more rounded, and the nuts will soften. Serve hot. </Instructions>
<Serves>4</Serves>
<Notes>In April I took a trip to New York and tasted around a dozen of the Soup Nazi&apos;s creations. TheMulligatawny was among my favs. After each daily trip to Soup Nazi&apos;s headquarters, I immediately headed back to the hotel and poured samples of the soups into labeled, sealed containers which were then chilled for the trip back home. There, in the home lab (okay, it&apos;s a kitchen) portions of the soup were rinsed through a sieve and ingredients were identified. After that, it was a matter of trial and error, figuring out the measurements for those ingredients. The result was a successful clone that I can now share with you. Just be sure when you make this soup, that you simmer it for at least four hours or until the soup reduces by more than half. The soup will darken as the flavors intensify, the potatoes will begin to fall apart and the nuts will soften. If you follow these directions you should end up with a clone that would fool even Cosmo himself. </Notes>

<Name>Mexican Chicken Chili </Name>
<Author>http://www.topsecretrecipes.com</Author>
<Ingredients>1 pound chicken breast fillets (4 fillets)
1 tablespoon olive oil
10 cups water
2 cups chicken stock
1/2 cup tomato sauce
1 potato, peeled &amp; chopped
1 small onion, diced
1 cup frozen yellow corn
1/2 carrot, sliced
1 celery stalk, diced
1 cup canned diced tomatoes
1 15-ounce can red kidney beans, plus liquid
1/4 cup diced canned pimento
1 jalapeno, diced
1/4 cup chopped Italian parsley
1 clove garlic, minced
1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder 
1 teaspoon cumin
1/4 teaspoon salt
dash cayenne pepper
dash basil
dash oregano

On the side
Sour cream
Pinch chopped Italian parsley</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Sauté the chicken breasts in the olive oil in a large pot over medium/high heat. Cook the chicken on both side until done -- about 7-10 minutes per side. Cool the chicken until it can be handled. Do not rinse the pot.
2. Shred the chicken by hand into bite-sizes pieces and place the pieces back into the pot.
3. Add the remaining ingredients to the pot and turn heat to high. Bring mixture to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 4-5 hours. Stir mixture often so that many of the chicken pieces shred into much smaller bits. Chili should reduce substantially to thicken and darken (less orange, more brown) when done.
4. Combine some chopped Italian parsley with sour cream and serve it on the side for topping the chili, if desired. </Instructions>

<Notes>here now is a clone for what has apparently become one of the Soup Nazi&apos;s most popular culinary masterpieces. The secret to this soup, as with many of his creations, seems to be the long simmering time.

<Instructions>Combine all of the ingredients in a pitcher or covered container. Stir or shake until sugar is dissolved. Chill and serve cold.
Makes 24 ounces. 

Tidbits
To make the &quot;Mocha&quot; variety:
Add a pinch (1/16 teaspoon) of cocoa powder to the mixture before combining.

To fake espresso with a drip coffee maker and standard grind of coffee:
Use 1/3 cup ground coffee and 1 cup of water.
Brew once then run coffee through machine again, same grounds.
Makes about 1/2 cup fresh espresso to use in the above recipe.
Run a pot of water through machine, without grounds, to clean.

*This is a natural thickener found in fruits that is used for canning. You can find it in the supermarket near the canning supplies. It is used in this recipe to make the drink thicker and creamier, and can be found in the original recipe. It does not add to the flavor and can be excluded if you don&apos;t care so much about duplicating the texture of the real thing.

2. Prepare fajitas using the following ingredients:

Prepare the fajitas using the same directions found on the package of the original seasoning mix:

1. COOK and stir chicken in hot oil in a large nonstick skillet 5 minutes on medium-high heat. Add TACO BELL Fajita Seasoning Mix, water, green pepper, and onion; cook and stir on medium heat 5 minutes or until chicken is cooked through and the vegetables are tender.

The clone of this mix, made with a combination of common spices and cornstarch, can be kept indefinitely until your brain&apos;s fajita-craving neurons begin firing. When you&apos;re set to cook, you&apos;ll just need some chicken, a bell pepper, and an onion, and then you simply follow the same instructions that you find on the package of the real thing. </Notes>

<Notes>It was two friendly Atlanta, Georgia neighbors who got together in 1955 to build the first Waffle House in their eventual 1200-restaurant chain. With the dimpled breakfast hotcake as a signature item (and this is 3 years before IHOP was founded!), the privately-held chain grew into 20 Southern U.S. states. Today tasty food at rock-bottom prices, plus 24-hours-a-day service, makes Waffle House a regular stop for devoted customers any time of the day or night. And don&apos;t even think about referring to your server as a waitress; they&apos;re called &quot;associates.&quot; 
     For the best clone of the 45-year-old secret formula for these waffles you really should chill this batter overnight in the fridge as they do in each of the restaurants. But, hey, sometimes you just can&apos;t wait, right? If you need instant gratification, the recipe still works fine if you cook up the waffles the same day. At least wait for 15-20 minutes after you make the batter so that it can rest and thicken a bit. That&apos;ll give you time to search for the waffle iron and heat it up. Also, you might need some time to dust it off. </Notes>

6 cups romaine lettuce, chopped
1/4 cup red cabbage, shredded
1/4 cup carrot, shredded
4 pita breads
4 teaspoons shredded, fresh Parmesan cheese</Ingredients>
<Instructions>1. Make the dressing by first dissolving the gelatin in the water. Heat the mixture in the microwave on high for two minutes or until it begins to boil rapidly. Add the vinegar, then whisk while adding the oil. Add bell pepper, salt, garlic powder, Worcestershire, black pepper, parsley, oregano, thyme and basil. Let dressing cool for about 15 minutes before adding cheeses and egg substitute. Whisk until slightly thicker, then chill. Overnight refrigeration makes the dressing thicker. 
2. Preheat a barbecue or indoor grill to medium heat. Salt and pepper the chicken, then grill it for 5 minutes per side, or until done. Remove chicken from the grill and dice it.
3. While chicken cooks, prepare the salad by combining the romaine lettuce, red cabbage and shredded carrot in a large bowl and toss.
4. Prepare the sandwiches by first microwaving each pita for 20 seconds. 
5. Fold each pita in half like a taco, then add 1 to 1 1/2 cups of the romaine salad into the bread.
6. Add about 1/3 cup of diced chicken on top of the salad in the pita.
7. Pour about a tablespoon of dressing over each sandwich.
8. Sprinkle about a teaspoon of shredded fresh Parmesan on top of each one and serve. </Instructions>

Serve like a regular hamburger. Tip: If you have a grill that tells the temperature, keep it down! Or let the coals die down some. Don&apos;t put lean buffalo meat in the flame. ( Buffalo is a lean red meat and is some what dry so you have to cook it slowly to keep the juices in.) These burgers were taste tested by the usually critical teen-age crowd. They asked for seconds. I take that as an impressive OK. </Instructions>

<Name>Cristel&apos;s Beef Strips with Sweet &amp; Hot Sauce</Name>
<Author>Cristel Morton</Author>
<Ingredients>1 lb Round steak 
2 tb Water 
1 ts Salt 
1/3 c Cooking oil 
1 Egg 
1 c Dry bread crumbs 
1/4 ts Ginger 
Dash of pepper

SWEET &amp; HOT SAUCE 
1/3 c Catsup 
2 1/2 tb Vinegar 
1/4 ts Dry mustard 
2 1/2 tb Sugar 
2 1/2 tb Soy sauce 
1/4 ts Hot pepper sauce </Ingredients>
<Instructions>Trim fat from steak. Cut steak into 3/4 inch wide strips. 
Beat the egg in a bowl with water until well mixed. 
In a separate bowl, mix bread crumbs, salt, ginger and pepper. 
Dip strips in egg mixture, then roll through crumb mixture. Arrange strips on a baking sheet *SEE NOTE BELOW* Chill in refrigerator at least 15 minutes *SEE NOTE BELOW* 
Depending on the size of the steak and the thickness of the cut, more egg and crumb mixture may be necessary. 
Heat oil in a large fry pan until hot. Oil should be about 1/4 inch deep in the pan. Remove strips from refrigerator and fry in oil a few at a time for about 30 - 40 sec per side (top &amp; bottom) turning once. Do not overcook. 
Remove strips and drain on paper towel. Keep the strips warm. (Placing paper towel on a cookie sheet and placing in a 200F oven seems to work well.) 

SWEET &amp; HOT SAUCE: 
Combine all ingredients for the sauce in a saucepan (or measuring cup) and stir together well. Heat on stove top, or in microwave until bubbly hot. 
Serve beef strips with hot sauce and french fries. 
NOTE: The steak can be cut and frozen so that the preparation time is greatly reduced. After the steak is cut, roll in flour and arrange so that the strips can be laid out to thaw in a single layer. If the strips are still chilled when it&apos;s time to cook them, just dip into the egg, roll in crumbs and place directly into the hot oil. The chilling process is to firm up the egg &amp; crumb mixture so that they don&apos;t fall off the meat during the frying. If the meat is already sufficiently cold (from defrosting), the chilling in the refrigerator is not necessary. </Instructions>

<Ingredients>4 lb Venison, bite size Chili grind fine *OR* 
Chuck, well trimmed, ground 
1 lg Onion, chopped 
2 Garlic cloves, minced 
1 ts Oregano 
1 ts Cumin seed 
2 c Hot water 
6 ts Chili powder 
1 1/2 c Canned whole tomato 
2 ds Liquid hot pepper sauce 
Salt to taste </Ingredients>
<Instructions>Place meat, onion and garlic in a large heavy skillet or Dutch oven. Cook until light colored. Add oregano, cumin, water, chili powder, tomatoes, hot pepper sauce (more or less to taste), and salt. Bring to a boil, lowering heat, and simmer for one hour. Skim off fat during cooking. AUTHOR&apos;S NOTE: 
Even more fat can be removed if chili is stored in refrigerator, allowing fat to rise to the top and solidify, when it can be easily removed. LBJ preferred venison in his chili, and so did his doctor, because it is so lean and fat-free. Ground beef heart is leaner still, and has a rich beef flavor with the added value of high Vit B content. </Instructions>

<Notes>This recipe was tailored to President Johnson after his first heart attack. Not only is it relatively fat-free, it calls for lean venison, when available.The local pronunciation of Pedernales is Purd-in-alice, and in this case local extends at least from Texas to Washington,D.C., to New York City. </Notes>

Uncover, increase heat to high and cook, stirring often until onions begin to dry out and turn a light golden color, another 10 minutes or so. Remove from the heat, scrape the onions into a bowl and set aside. Stuff a cheese slice and a bacon rasher in each loaf of bread. Using the handle of a large wooden spoon, stuff in the meat and onions. Choose a skillet or roasting pan large enough to hold 4 sandwiches and choose a flat cover that is smaller than the pan. Heat half the remaining oil over low heat, place the sandwiches in the skillet with the cover on top of the sandwiches. Place a 2-pound weight on the cover and cook for about 5 minutes. Remove the cover, turn the sandwiches and add the remaining oil. Replace the cover and press down with the weights. Cook another 5 minutes. Remove the sandwiches from the heat and keep warm in a 250F oven while you cook the remaining 2 sandwiches. To serve, cut each sandwich in half, then diagonally cut each half into triangular pieces. </Instructions>

1/2 Chicken breast;cubed freshly ground black pepper 
1 tb Flour;unbleached

6 qt -Water 
3 c Marinara sauce;(Momma&apos;s Tomato sauce) or Meat Sauce </Ingredients>
<Instructions>Remove the roots and stems from spinach and save for later use. Rinse spinach in cold water as many times as necessary to rid it of any sand. Place in a pot with no water other than the water the spinach retains from washing. Add a pinch of salt and cook, covered for about 5 minutes. Transfer to a colander and set aside to drain. Place oil, onion, carrot and chicken breast in a large skillet. Add 1 tsp salt and 1/8 tsp pepper and cook over moderate heat for 4 to 5 minutes longer or until most of the liquid has evaporated. Add flour and stir 1 more minute. Remove from heat; cool for 5 or 6 minutes, then chop very fine. Roll the dough paper thin and place over a floured board. With a feather brush dipped in cold water lightly brush the top to maintain moisture. Place mounds of spinach mixture on the dough in straight lines about 2 inches apart (measurements are from the centers of the mounds), making 8 or 9 dozen of them. Roll out the other half of the dough paper thin and place loosely over the sheet with the mounds. With an Italian pastry wheel, press along the furrows, cutting and sealing at the same time. Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil. Add ravioli and 3 Tbsp salt. Stir until boiling resumes. Cook 4 to 5 minutes, uncovered. Drain and serve with marinara or meat sauce. </Instructions>

<Notes>To quote the author, &quot;I suppose that the tradition of making spinach ravioli on Purim originated because Purim comes in the season when spinach is tender, flavorful and abundant. Now we can make spinach ravioli throughout the year, but they never taste as good as they do around Purim.&quot; </Notes>

Heat oil in casserole. Saute onion and pepper until transparent. Add garlic, parsley, tomato, bay leaf, nutmeg, cumin and thyme. Mix well, cover, and cook over low heat until mushy (about 15 minutes). The saffron should be toasting on the lid in the little brown paper. 
Add the shrimp to the saute and cook until it turns pink. Dissolve the saffron in the 1 cup hot water. Combine with wine, lemon juice, salt and hot sauce. Pour into casserole, stir to mix, and cook covered 10 minutes more. Now add the rice and the 2 1/2 cups of water. Distribute ingredients well in casserole. Bring to a quick boil, STIR ONCE, and place in preheated 325 degree F. oven for only 20 minutes - NI UN MINUTO MAS! Remove from oven, uncover, and garnish with peas, pimientos, and parsley.

(2) Saute&apos; the vegetables except the tomatoes in the olive oil in small batches. Saut&apos; each batch for 2 or 3 minutes, then remove from the pan, trying to drain some of the oil so that enough oil is left for the next batch. When you&apos;re done, most (if not all) of the oil should be gone from the pan. 
(3) Place the saute&apos;ed vegetables in a baking dish and toss them briefly so that you won&apos;t get only one kind of vegetable in one place.

If the dough seems too soft to roll out easily, dust it with more sugar and knead until the consistency is manageable, but avoid adding any more sugar than absolutely necessary. Roll out the dough to 1/4 inch thickness, lifting it with a spatula frequently and redusting the surface and rolling pin with powdered sugar to prevent sticking. Cut out the cookies using a 2 1/4-inch heart-shaped (or similar) cutter. Use a spatula to transfer the cookies to the prepared baking sheets, about 1 inch apart. 
Bake the cookies for 9 to 12 minutes or until almost firm on top and slightly puffy. Let them stand on the foil lined baking sheets until completely cooled. Peel from the foil. Store airtight for 3 to 4 days. Freeze, airtight, for longer storage. 
Makes about forty 2 1/4-inch cookies. </Instructions>

<Author>Fred Peters</Author>
<Ingredients>2/3 c Clover honey 
2/3 c Granulated sugar 
1 tb Kirsch (cherry brandy) or orange juice 
2 1/2 ts Ground cinnamon 
1/4 ts Ground cloves 
Finely grated peel (yellow part only) of one 
Large lemon 
1/4 c Finely chopped candied lemon peel 
1/4 c Finely chopped candied orange peel 
2/3 c Finely chopped blanched slivered almonds 
2 1/4 c All-purpose or unbleached white flour (or more) 
1 1/2 c Powdered sugar 
1/8 ts Vanilla extract </Ingredients>
<Instructions>Heat the oven to 350F. Generously grease two 10-by-14-inch or larger baking shets. Stir together the honey, sugar, and kirsch in a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat. Heat the mixture, stirring, until the sugar completely dissolves and the mixture is hot but not boiling. Remove from the heat and stir in the spices, lemon peel, candied peels, and almonds until completely incorporated. Stirring vigorously, gradually ad 2 1/4 cups of flour to the pan; the mixture will become very stiff. If the mixture feels sticky and too soft to roll out, stir or knead in a bit more flour, but be careful not to overflour. Set the mixture aside until cooled to barely warm. 
Sprinkle a work surface generously with flour. Divide the dough in half. Roll out half of dough into an 8 1/2-by-13-inch rectangle, frequently running a spatula under the dough and dusting the work surface. As needed, also dust the top of the dough and the rolling pin with flour. Transfer the dough to a prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the second half of the dough. Prick the dough lightly all over with the tines of a fork. 
Stagger the baking sheets on racks in the center third of the oven; switch positions halfway through the baking to ensure even browning. Bake for 13 to 16 minutes or until the dough top is just tinged with brown and slightly darker on the edges; avoid overbaking, as cookies will become crunchy and hard. Carefully run a spatula under the dough rectangles to loosen them from the pans. 
When just cool enough to handle, transfer the rectangles to a cutting board and cut away any uneven, dry edges using a large serrated knife. Deeply score the rectangles, but do not cut completely through the surface, lengthwise and crosswise, to yield 1-by-2 1/2-inch bars. Return the scored rectangles to the baking sheets. In a small saucepan stir together the powdered sugar, vanilla, and 3 tablespoons of water until thoroughly blended. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring. Boil, stirring, for 20 to 30 seconds, until smooth, very fluid, and translucent. Divide the mixture between the rectangles, pour over the top and quickly spread the glaze over the entire surface. Let stand until the glaze sets and turns white again, about 1 hour. Bend the rectangles to break apart or cut through the score marks to separate into bars. Let stand until the glaze is dry and hard. Pack airtight. Store for up to 3 weeks or more. 
Makes 50 to 60 1-by-2 1/2-inch bars. </Instructions>

<Name>Rolled Buttery Lemon Cookies </Name>
<Author>THE BALTIMORE SUN</Author>
<Ingredients>1/2 c Butter, slightly softened (1 stick) 
2/3 c Granulated sugar, plus more for garnishing 
1 lg Egg 
Finely grated peel (yellow part only) of 1 large 
Lemon 
1 3/4 c All-purpose or unbleached white flour 
1 lg Egg yolk beaten with 1 tablespoon water 
For glazing cookies. </Ingredients>
<Instructions>Grease several baking sheets and set aside. With a mixer at medium speed, beat the butter in a large mixer bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in the sugar until well blended and smooth. Beat in the egg and lemon peel. With the mixer at low speed, beat in the flour just until evenly incorporated. 
Divide the dough in half. Place each portion between large sheets of waxed paper. Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough to a scant 1/4 inch thick. Check the undersides and smooth out any wrinkles in the waxed paper. Stack the rolled portions on a tray or baking sheet. Refrigerate for about 20 minutes or until cold and firm, but not hard. 
Heat the oven to 375F. Working with one chilled portion of dough at a time (keep the other one chilled), peel away a layer of waxed paper. (This makes it easier to lift the cookies from the paper later.) Replace the paper and turn the dough over. Peel of the second layer of paper. Using a 2-inch round or scalloped cutter (or a small juice of sherry glass) cut out the cookies. Use a spatula to carefully lift the cookies from the paper and place them about 1 inch apart on the baking sheets. Reroll the dough scraps between waxed paper; rechill in the refrigerator. Repeat the process with the second portion of dough. 
Working with a few cookies at a time, brush the tops with the egg yolk-water mixture using a pastry brush or paper towel. Sprinkle the tops lightly with granulated sugar. Repeat until all of the cookies are garnished. 
Bake the cookies for 6 to 9 minutes or until the top is just tinged with brown and slightly darker at the edges. Let cool on the baking sheets for about 2 minutes. Transfer to wire racks and let stand until thoroughly cool. Store airtight for up to a week. Freeze for longer storage.

<Author>A Salute to Cheese</Author>
<Ingredients>1 c Biscuit mix 
3 tb Butter 
1/4 c Light cream 

FILLING: 
1 Onion, large, sliced or chopped 
2 tb Butter 
2 Eggs, beaten 
2 c Natural Gruyere cheese (1/2 lb), shredded 
1/4 ts Salt </Ingredients>
<Instructions>PASTRY: 

A Swiss cheese pie is called &quot;flan.&quot; The pastry for this pie is sometimes closer to a rich biscuit dough, but in other versions a short pastry may be used. The word &quot;flan&quot; means different things in different countries; In Spain it is plain cramel custard, in France a fruit tart in pastry, in Switzerland a cheese custard in pastry. And sometimes Swiss Flan is made with onions and cheese in custard! 
TO MAKE THE PASTRY, chop butter into the biscuit mix, work in cream, and roll out on lightly floured board; or press into a 9 inch pie plate, fluting the edges. Chill while preparing filling. 
FOR THE FILLING, cook onion in butter until golden; cool slightly. Add eggs, cheese, and salt. Pour this mixture into pastry, and bake in oven preheated to 425 degrees F. (very hot) for 15 minutes; then reduce heat to 350 degrees F. (moderate) and continue baking 25 to 30 minutes or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Serve warm as a luncheon entree to 4 to 6 persons, or cut into small wedges for appetizers. Makes 10 to 12 appetizers. 
VARIATIONS: Instead of this pastry, regular pie crust may be used. Or make pastry of 1 cup flour, 1 teaspoon baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/3 cup butter, and 1 beaten egg. Do not attempt to roll out this butter-rich pastry; press it with your fingers into pie pan, fluting the edges</Instructions>

<Ingredients>4 c Stone Ground 
Whole wheat flour 
2 c White flour 
1 1/2 ts Salt 
1 1/2 ts Baking soda 
2 c Buttermilk or sweet milk </Ingredients>
<Instructions>Mix the whole wheat flour throughly with the white flour, salt, and soda. 
Make a well in the center and gradually mix in the liquid. Stir with a wooden spoon. You may need lass, or more liquid - it depends on the absorbent quality of the flour. The dough should be soft but managable. 
Knead the dough into a ball in the mixing bowl with your floured hands. Put on a lightly floured baking sheet and with the palm of your hand flatten out in a circle 1 1/2 inches thick. With a knife dipped in flour, make a cross through the center of the bread so that it will easily break into quarters when it is baked. 
Bake at 425 degrees for 25 minutes, reduce the heat to 350 degrees and bake a further 15 minutes. 
If the crust seems too hard, wrap the baked bread in a damp tea cloth. Leave the loaf standing upright until it is cool. 
The bread should not be cut until it has set - about 6 hours after it comes out of the oven. </Instructions>

<Author>Fred Peters</Author>
<Ingredients>4 1/4 c All-purpose flour (up to 4 1/2 cups) 
4 ts Baking powder 
1/2 ts Baking soda 
1 ts Salt 
3 tb Granulated sugar 
1 tb Caraway seeds 
1 c Dark seedless raisins 
2 c Buttermilk 
Butter 
Sugar </Ingredients>
<Instructions>Preheat the oven to 350F. Grease a 9-inch black cast-iron skillet or cake pan and dust with flour. 
In a large bowl, mix 4 cups of the flour with the baking powder, baking soda, salt, sugar, and caraway seeds. Add the raisins, mixing them in with your fingers to make sure they are separated. Add the buttermilk to the bowl and mix with a fork until the mixture forms a dough. 
Sprinkle about 1/4 cup more of the flour on a board or counter. Turn out the dough and knead for about 5 minutes, working in the flour from the board and forming the dough into a smooth round loaf about 8 inches in diameter. (If the humidity is high and the dough is very sticky, you may need to add another 1/4 cup of flour to the board.) 
Press the dough evenly into the prepared skillet or pan and cut a cross 1/2 inch deep across the top. Bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until the loaf sounds hollow when rapped on the bottom. Remove the loaf to a wire rack and rub the top with butter. Sprinkle with sugar. Let the bread cool completely before slicing. 
This Irish bread tastes even better the second day and is particularly good for breakfast. 
Makes one large loaf. </Instructions>

<Author>Paul A. Meadows</Author>
<Ingredients>3/4 lb Unsalted Butter; Chilled, * 
3 3/4 c Unbleached Flour; PLUS 
3 1/3 c Unbleached Flour 
1/2 ts Salt 
8 tb Ice Water; May Use Up To 10 
1/2 c Sugar 
1/2 ts Baking Powder 
1 ts Cinnamon 
1/2 ts Mace 
1/8 ts Allspice 
1/4 ts Black Pepper; Freshly Ground 
3 c Seedless Raisins 
3 c White Or Golden Raisins 
1/2 c Almonds; Ground 
1 1/2 c Almonds; Coarsely Chopped 
3 Eggs; Lg 
1/2 c Buttermilk or Milk 
1 c Brandy 
1 Egg;Lg, Beaten 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>* The butter, 3 sticks, should be cut into small pieces. 

 In a medium-sized mixing bowl, combine the butter, 3 3/4 c flour, and 1/4 ts of salt. With your fingers, work the ingredients together until you form small granules that are fairly uniform in size. Sprinkle 8 tb of the ice water over the granules and continue mixing until you can gather the ingredients into a ball. If the dough crumbles, add additional ice water, 1 tb at a time, until a soft ball can be formed. With the flat of your hand, press the dough into a thick cake, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.

 Prepare the filling by sifting the 3 1/2 cups of flour, the sugar, baking powder, spices, and remaining 1/4 ts of salt into a large bowl. Add the freshly ground black pepper, seedless and white or golden raisins, ground and coarsely chopped almonds. Mix thoroughly until all the fruits and nuts are coated well with the dry ingredients. Add the 3 eggs, milk, and brandy mixing well. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. and, on a lightly floured surface, roll two-thirds of the chilled pastry to a thickness of 1/4-inch. Gently place a 9 X 3 1/2-inch springform pan on the pastry. With a small sharp knife,cut along the outside of the pan to make a disk. 

Line the bottom of the pan with the disk of pastry. Use the remaining pieces of rolled-out pasty to line the sides of the pan, slightly overlapping the pastry on the bottom and letting the pastry extend about 1/2-inch above the top of the form. Spoon the filling into the pan, packing it down firmly and press the excess pastry over the filling. Brush the pastry with a little of the beaten egg. In the same fashion, roll out the remaining pastry into a circle larger than the form. Roll the pastry around the rolling pin to lift it and unroll it on the top of the form. Press the top pastry against the filling and the pastry below to make a tight seal and trim off the excess. Brush the entire top with the beaten egg. Cut a 1-inch round vent in the middle of the bun, and if you like, use the pastry scraps to make leaves. Roll the scraps together and cut out tear drop shapes to resemble leaves. Score the top, with a small sharp knife, to resemble the ribs of the leaves. Brush the undersides of the leaves with the remaining beaten egg to make them adhere to the top of the bun. Then brush the top again with the beaten egg. Bake on a rack in the middle of the oven for 2 to 2 1/2 hours, or until the pastry is a rich golden brown. If the decorations color much faster than the top sheath of pasty, cover them with aluminum foil to reflect the oven heat and retard the browning.

<Ingredients>4 1/2 To 5 cups all-purpose flour 
1 pk Dry yeast (about 1 1/2 tsp.) 
1 c Milk 
1/3 c Butter 
1/3 c Sugar 
1/2 ts Salt 
3 Eggs 
3/4 c Packed brown sugar 
1/4 c All-purpose flour 
1 tb Ground cinnamon 
1/2 c Butter 
1/2 c Light raisins 
1/2 c Chopped pecans 
1 tb Half-and-half or light cream 
1 Recipe Powdered Sugar Glaze (to follow</Ingredients>
<Instructions>In a large mixer bowl, combine 2 1/4 cups of the flour and the yeast. 
In a small saucepan heat the milk, the 1/3 cup butter, the 1/3 cup sugar, and salt just till warm (120 degrees to 130 degrees) and butter is almost melted, stirring constantly. Add to flour mixture. Add eggs. Beat with an electric mixer on low speed for 30 seconds, scraping sides of bowl constantly. Beat on high speed for 3 minutes. Using a wooden spoon, stir in as much of the remaining 2 1/4 to 2 3/4 cups flour as you can. 
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead in enough of the remaining flour to make a moderately soft dough that is smooth and elastic (3 to 5 minutes total). Shape into a ball. Place in a greased bowl, turning once. Cover; let rise in a warm place till double (about 1 hour). 
For filling, combine brown sugar, the 1/4 cup flour, and cinnamon. Cut in remaining butter till crumbly; set aside. 
Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes. Roll the dough into a 12&quot; square. 
Sprinkle filling over dough square; top with raisins and pecans. Roll up jelly-roll style; pinch edges to seal. Slice roll into eight 1 1/2&quot; pieces. Arrange dough pieces, cut side up, in a greased 12&quot; deep-dish pizza pan or a 13x9x2&quot; baking pan. 
Cover dough loosely with clear plastic wrap, leaving room for rolls to rise. Refrigerate rolls 2 to 24 hours. Uncover and let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes (Or, for immediate baking, don&apos;t chill dough. Instead, cover loosely; let dough rise in a warm place till nearly double, about 45 minutes). 
Break any surface bubbles with a greased toothpick. Brush dough with half-and-half or light cream. Bake in a 375 degree oven for 25 to 30 minutes or till light brown. If necessary to prevent overbrowning, cover rolls loosely with foil the last 5 to 10 minutes of baking. Remove rolls from oven. Brush again with half-and-half or light cream. Cool for 1 minute. Carefully invert cinnamon rolls onto a wire rack. Cool slightly. Invert again onto a serving platter. Drizzle with Powdered Sugar Glaze. Serve warm. Makes 8 rolls. 
VARIATION: Apple Cinnamon Rolls: Prepare rolls as directed, except substitute 1 cup finely chopped apple for the raisins in the filling. 

POWDERED SUGAR GLAZE: 

In a bowl stir together 1 1/4 cups sifted powdered sugar, 1 tsp. corn syrup, 1/2 tsp. vanilla, and enough half-and-half or light cream (1 to 2 Tbsp.) to make of drizzling consistency</Instructions>
<Serves>8</Serves>
<Notes>The best part about making this recipe is that the dough can be mixed and the rolls filled and shaped the night before. When you awake in the morning, just bake. Waiting for the rolls to come out of the oven is the hardest part </Notes>

1/2 c Butter 
1/2 c Sugar 
1/4 c Sugar, brown 
2 Eggs 
8 oz Sour cream 
1 c Blueberries 
1/2 c Pecans, chopped </Ingredients>
<Instructions>Day before: Cook sausage and drain well. Stir together flour, baking powder, and baking soda. In large mixing bowl, beat butter until fluffy. Add sugars and beat until well-blended. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each. Alternate adding flour mixture and sour cream to creamed ingredients; mix well. Fold in sausage and berries. Pour batter into ungreased 13&quot;x9&quot;x2&quot; baking pan. Sprinkle pecans on top. Refrigerate overnight. 

Preheat oven to 350. Bake 35-40 minutes, until done. Cool on wire rack. 
Sylvia&apos;s notes: With two young kids, I didn&apos;t want to use chopped nuts, so I sprinkled raw oats on top. Then, I didn&apos;t have a 13&quot;x9&quot; pan, so used two 8&quot;x3-3/4&quot; pans. And my oven was broken so I used my toaster oven and baked one pan 35 minutes at 350. The batter is so thick it&apos;s very hard to work with; I need to add more liquid next time. It&apos;s also too rich to bake easily, think I&apos;ll replace some sour cream with water or milk.

1 Pizza crust 

</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Prepare your favorite pizza crust and get ready to bake, as a regular pizza. Make sure that you have a fairly high ridge, as the there is a lot of mixture, and it is fairly watery. Pugliese bread dough works very well for a crust. 
Beat eggs lightly. Add cheese, onion and salt and pepper. Mix gently. 
Lightly brush olive oil over the pizza base. Pour mixture over the crust. Place rings of green pepper over the top. You can also include onion rings, mushrooms, or other favorite Pizza toppings. Color contrast helps here, as the mixture is rather plain looking. 
Bake at 450 degrees for about 15-20 mins, or when crust is brown and egg mixture is set.

<Author>Irene Chalmers</Author>
<Ingredients>4 Eggs 
1 tb Dry sherry 
Carrots, finely chopped 
(for garnish) 

FILLING: 
1 c (about 1/2 lb) ground pork, 
Uncooked 
2 md Fresh mushrooms, 
Chopped fine 
2 Scallions, chopped fine 
(white parts separate from 
The green) 
2 ts Cornstarch, dissolved in 
2 tb Water, cold 
1/2 tb Dark soy sauce 
1 tb Dry sherry 
1 ts Salt 
1 tb Peanut oil 

SAUCE: 
2 tb Oyster sauce 
1 tb Light soy sauce 
1 tb Plum sauce 
Dash hot chili oil or 
Tabasco 
Sauce 

</Ingredients>
<Instructions>In a bowl, stir the eggs with the dry sherry. In a mixing bowl, combine all the filling ingredients, include only the white parts of the chopped scallions (save the green parts for garnish) and stir to blend well. In a 8-inch skillet, heat the oil lightly. Pour about a quarter of the egg mixture to cover the bottom of the skillet. Heat until the egg pancake has barely set, then transfer to a plate. Make 3 more pancakes. Divide the filling into 4 portions and put a portions on each pancake. Moisten your fingers with cold water and spread the filling mixture evenly over the surface of the pancake, then roll up tightly, as you would a jelly roll. Seal with a little leftover egg from the egg-beating bowl. Place the rolls on a flat plate that will fit your steamer, and then steam them over an inch of simmering water for 15 minutes. In a bowl, mix together the sauce ingredients. To serve, cut the rolls into slices, cutting on the slant. Drizzle the sauce over them and top with the scallion greens and the carrots.</Instructions>

<Name>Garlic Pancakes with Ham Sauce</Name>
<Author>John Keith Drummond, San Francisco, CA</Author>
<Ingredients>1/2 lb Butter 
3 tb Rubbed sage 
3 Large heads fresh garlic 
2 c Self rising flour 
2 Eggs 
2 tb Oil 
3 1/2 c Milk 
9 Large cloves fresh garlic, minced 
1 lb Lean ham, minced 

</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Mix together 12 tablespoons (1-1/2 sticks) butter and sage; reserve. Remove as much outer skin from garlic as possible without piercing the cloves&apos; covering. Set garlic in saucepan, cover with water and boil gently about 45 minutes or until cloves are quite soft. Remove from heat. When cool enough to handle squeeze each clove to remove cooked garlic by grasping clove at tip and pulling down toward base. In mixing bowl, beat garlic with fork until smooth. Add to garlic same amount (at least one cup) flour, eggs, oil and 1-1/2 cups milk to make pancake batter. Add minced garlic to batter and set aside. Melt remaining 4 tablespoons butter and keep warm. While waiting for batter to work, place half the sage butter (6 tb) in saucepan, add 6 tb flour to make a roux and cook at medium temperature, stirring frequently, to brown. Meanwhile in skillet, place remaining 2 tb of remaining sage butter and add ham. Heat thru, but do not burn. When roux is nicely browned, add remaining 2 cups milk. Allow to thicken, stirring frequently. Add ham and skillet drippings and mix to make ham sauce. Keep warm. Heat griddle or clean skillet and grease lightly with a bit of remaining sage butter. Drop batter by spoonfuls onto griddle to make silver dollar-sized pancakes. Serve with melted butter and ham sauce</Instructions>
<Serves>1</Serves>
<Notes>Finalist in 1983 Gilroy, California recipe contest. John Keith Drummond, San Francisco, CA. 
Cooking the garlic until it is soft changes its flavor from pungent to sweet and nut-like -- a very good addition to pancakes and a pleasant compliment to the smokiness of the ham sauce. Serve for breakfast, brunch, lunch or even a light supper. </Notes>

<Ingredients>1/3 c Sifted all-purpose flour 
4 ts Sugar 
1/4 ts Salt 
1/4 ts Pepper 
5 lg Eggs; beaten until frothy 
1/2 lb Ground pork shoulder 
6 md Scallions; trimmed sliced thin (include some green tops) 
3 lg Garlic cloves peeled and minced 
2 ts Oriental sesame oil 
1/2 lb Tender young asparagus trimmed of coarse stem ends peeled and cut into moderately fine julienne 
2 tb Vegetable oil 

DIPPING SAUCE: 
1 1&quot; cube ginger peeled and minced 
1/3 c Soy sauce 
1 tb Cider vinegar 
1 tb Mirin (sweet rice wine) 
1 ts Hot sesame oil</Ingredients>
<Instructions>SIFT THE FLOUR, SALT, PEPPER and 2 teaspoons of the sugar into a large bowl. Make a well in the center and pour the eggs into it. Stir just enough to combine the ingredients. In a medium skillet set over moderate heat, stir-fry the pork, scallions, and two-thirds of the garlic in the sesame oil for 8-to-10 minutes, until the pork is no longer pink; do not brown the meat. Add the asparagus, toss for 1-or-2 minutes over moderate heat, then allow the mixture to cool to room temperature. In a separate bowl, combine the remaining ingredients, except the vegetable oil, to make a dipping sauce. When the pork mixture is cool, stir it into the reserved batter. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over moderately high heat until ripples show on the skillet bottom. Half fill a 1/4-cup measuring cup with the batter and drop the batter into the hot oil, evening up the ragged edges of the pancake. Add 3 more pancakes to the skillet, smoothing the edges as before, and brown them for 1-to-1 1/2 minutes per side. Drain them on paper towels, then keep them warm on an uncovered platter in a 250F oven. Fry the rest of the pancakes, adding more vegetable oil to the skillet if needed. Serve the pancakes hot with the dipping sauce. </Instructions>

3 ts Sugar 
1 1/3 c Milk 
1 c Butter (2 sticks) 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Cinnamon sugar Juice of 1 lemon jam...suggested are loganberry, boysenberry or seedless raspberry 
You will need a LARGE skillet for these... 
Beat the eggs until light and frothy. Add flour, salt, sugar and milk. Beat for 5 minutes more. The batter will be thin, but very smooth and creamy. 
Place 2 T of butter into the pan for each pancake. Heat until pan is very hot, but don&apos;t allow butter to burn. Ladle in enough batter with one hand so that, with the other hand holding the skillet handle and rotating the skillet, there is just enough batter to cover the bottom and slightly up the sides of thepan, but not a lot of excess. This will produce a giant, crepelike pancake. 
Check the cake by gently lifting the edge with a spatula. When it is nicely browned, tunr the cake. The second side will brown quickly. 
Place the pancake onto a warm plate, sprinkle with cinnamon sugar then lemon juice, then spread with jam. Roll up like a small jellyroll, sprinle again with cinnamon sugar, cut into two pieces, and serve.

<Ingredients>1/2 Recipe basic sweet dough (recipe follows) 
1/4 c Melted sweet butter 
1 tb Cinnamon 
1/2 c Sugar 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Make basic sweet dough. Grease a baking sheet. Roll the dough into arectangular sheet 1/2&quot; thick. Sprinkle liberally with melted butter, cinnamon and sugar. Roll tightly like a jelly roll and cut into 1&quot; thick slices. Place about 1&quot; apart on baking sheet. Let rise for 1 hour and bake in 350 degree oven for about 45 minutes. Remove from oven - cool and ice with powdered sugar glaze. 
BASIC SWEET DOUGH (makes enough for two dozen cinnamon rolls) 
1 qt milk 3 oz yeast (6 small squares) 2 cups sugar 14 cups all purpose flour 1 tb salt 1 lb sweet butter 12 egg yolks 
Scald milk and cool to lukewarm. Add yeast, 1 c. sugar and 2 c flour. This is your sponge. Let it rise about 30 minutes. In a large bowl, sift in the rest of the flour, salt and remaining sugar. With your fingertips, work butter into the dry ingredients, then add yolks and the yeast sponge. Stir, then work with your hands until quite thick. Knead the dough on a board sprinkled with flour until it becomes smooth and elastic. You may have to add more flour to make for easier handling. Cover and let rise about 1 - 1 /2 hours. Punch down and knead again for a few minutes. Cover and let rise again for 30 minutes.

1 Egg 
1/4 pt Milk or cream </Ingredients>
<Instructions>Sift the flour with the raising agents and stir in the sugar. Make a well in the centre and break the egg into it. Whisk the milk into the egg, then gradually incorporate the dry ingredients to make a very smooth, thick batter. Alternately, simply mix everything together in a food processor. If time permits let the batter stand for 30 minutes before cooking. Heat a griddle, bakestone or cast-iron frying pan until very hot - or cook direct on the hot plate of an Aga. Grease your chosen surface lightly with buttered paper, using just enough fat to prevent the pancakes from sticking. Using a large metal spoon held point downward, drop a few small rounds of batter on to the hot surface. Space them well apart. Cook over steady heat until bubbles rise to the surface and the underside of the pancakes are browned - about 2 minutes. Loosen them gently with a palette knife, then flip them over and cook for about 1 minute longer. </Instructions>

4 ts Oil 
1 1/2 c Milk plus 1 Tbsp 
1/2 lb Monkfish 
6 Scallops 
3/4 c Milk 
2 Garlic cloves, chopped 
1/2 lb Shrimp, shelled

3 tb Flour 
1/4 c Light cream 
1 c Gruyere Cheese 
2 tb Parsley, fresh, chopped 
1 Salt and pepper 
1 1/2 tb Oil for frying 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Make pancake batter by mixing flour and salt in mixing bowl. Make well in center and pour in the egg, 4 tsp oil and 1 cup milk. Whisk to smooth batter then add remaining milk. 
Remove any skin from monkfish, rinse and cut into bite-size pieces. Pat dry. Rinse and pat dry scallops, cut in half. Pour 3/4 cup milk into saucepan, add garlic and bring to simmer. Add all fish except shrimp. Simmer for 5-6 minutes then add shrimp. When shrimp turn pink remove all fish to a bowl and set aside. Strain fish milk and reserve for sauce. Place butter in saucepan and melt, add flour and stir for 2 minutes, then pour in reserved milk and the cream. Continue to stir and simmer for a few minutes until you have a smooth sauce. Turn heat to low, add cheese and parsley and season to taste with salt and pepper. Add fish, mix well. 
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. 
Place small frying pan or omelet pan over high heat. Lightly grease it with a little oil. Beat pancake batter, then pour 3 Tbsp into pan. Turn pan so bottom is covered evenly with batter and cook for 40-60 seconds, turn and cook 30-40 seconds longer. Transfer to large plate. Continue with remaining batter. (There should be enough filling for 10 pancakes.) Place an equal amount of filling (about 3 Tbsp) in center of each pancake, fold the sides over filling and arrange in ovenproof dish just large enough to hold pancakes. Place in oven for 20 minutes, or until the pancakes are hot through. Serve immediately. 
These thin pancakes, which conceal a tasty mixture of fish, will appeal to the masked and mysterious side of the Cancerian, who when in need of refreshment and quiet will reture into his or her own protective shell. These can be served as a first course or as a luncheon dish for four, with a green salad and a very chilled white wine.

<Ingredients>FOR THE PANCAKES: 
2 oz Buckwheat flour 
2 oz Plain white flour 
2 Eggs 
2 tb Butter; melted 
1/4 pt Milk 
1/4 pt Water 

FOR THE FILLING: 
2 lb Fresh spinich 
1 lg Onion 
3 oz Stilton cheese 
2 oz Walnut pieces 
Butter 
1 Garlic sliver 

FOR THE SAUCE: 
1 oz Butter 
1 oz Plain white flour 
1/2 pt Stock 
1/4 pt Double cream 
2 tb Freshly grated Parmesan 
1 ts (heaped) Dijon mustard 

</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Make a smooth batter with the flours, eggs, milk and water, then stir in the cool melted butter for extra richness and to prevent sticking during cooking. Use a 6-inch pan and make thin pancakes in the usual way, but be sure to stir the batter vigorously in between making each pancake or all the buckwheat flour will sink to the bottom of the mixture. If preparing ahead, cool the pancakes then stack them (interleaved with greaseproof paper) and wrap in a foil parcel. 
To make the filling, wash and boil or steam the spinach until just tender. Chop it and squeeze out all the liquid (save the juices for a soup). Chop the onion finely and sweat it in a knob of butter until it&apos;s deliciously soft. Stir in the spinach, season with a little salt, lots of pepper and the garlic. Toast the walnuts and crumbled Stilton into the spinach mixture to give it savoury flavour and bite. Stuff the pancakes with the mixture, roll them up neatly and pile them into a lightly buttered gratin dish. Cover with foil and heat through in the oven for 25-30 minutes at 400 F (200 C) gas mark 6. 
Make a smooth rich sauce with the butter, flour, stock (preferably good chicken stock) and cream. Let it simmer for about 5 minutes, stirring once or twice, then season with the cheese, mustard and salt and pepper. If the sauce is made ahead, reheat it in a double-boiler for serving, then pour it over the dish of pancakes just before bringing to table</Instructions>

1 ts Vanilla 
1/2 c Sour cream, do not use lite sour cream it is not thick 
Enough 

Vanilla Sugar: 
2 ts Vanilla 
1 1/2 c Sugar (Can use lessor use left over sugar in something else.) 
</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Soften yeast in warm water, sift flour and salt in mixing bowl. Cut in butter and shortning until size of peas. Blend eggs, sour cream, 1 tsp vanilla, yeast and water together. Add to dry mixture gently so that you keep the butter in little chunks. 
Chill, wrapped in plastic wrap for two hours or up to 4 days. 
Divide into two balls. For each ball,roll out into a 6 x 12 inch rectangle. Sprinkle with some of the vanilla sugar, fold in thirds, turn. Do this three or four times.Roll out one more time and cut into 12 equal strips 1 X 6 inches. Twist, roll in vanilla sugar and put on cookie sheet. Do the second ball or save it for another day. The recipe makes about 24 twists. 
I tried the recipe using &quot;lite&quot; sour cream and it was too sticky. The dough should not need any flour because you are using the sugar to keep the dough from sticking to the board. 
Bake at 375 for 15 to 20 min.These should be lightly browned, do not overcook. You will notice that there are little layers of dough with sugar in between. </Instructions>

<Ingredients>300 g/10 oz/1 1/2 cups uncooked rice
150 g/5 oz/3/4 cup black gram (urad dhal) 
2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 teaspoons sugar
2 teaspoons ghee or oil
1/2 teaspoon black mustard seeds
1 small onion, finely chopped
1 fresh green chilli, seeded and chopped
extra ghee or oil for cooking</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Wash rice and dhal separately and soak each in cold water to cover for at least 8 hours. Drain rice and grind in an electric blender, adding just enough water to facilitate blending. Strain through a fine sieve and discard any rough residue. Rinse blender and grind the dhal, adding a little cold water if necessary. This should not need straining as the dhal blends more easily than rice. Combine dhal and rice and mix well, adding salt and sugar. Cover and leave to ferment in a warm place for about 3 hours. 

Heat ghee in a small saucepan and fry mustard seeds until they begin to pop. Add onion and chilli and fry over low heat, stirring now and then, until onions are soft and start to colour. Remove from heat. When cool, stir onion mixture into the batter, which should be of a thick pouring consistency. Thin it down if necessary with a little cold water. 

Heat a heavy frying pan or crepe pan and grease with a very little ghee or oil. Pour in about 1/3 cup batter, or just enough to cover the base of the pan thinly. The trick for making successful dosai is to spread the batter very quickly with the back of the ladle or metal cup used for pouring. Cook on low heat until the bottom is well browned. Turn over and cook other side. Serve with coconut chatni and dry potato curry. </Instructions>

<Notes>Called dosa or dosai in India, these are one of the most popular of snacks or light meals, especially the variety known as &apos;paper dosa&apos; which is at least 40 cm (16 in) in diameter, as fine and crisp as a wafer, and encloses a spicy potato filling.

1 tablespoon melted butter
125 g/4 oz/1 cup plain (all-purpose) flour, sifted
butter or ghee for frying

Filling
1 coconut, freshly grated
125 g/4 oz jaggery or brown sugar</Ingredients>
<Instructions>In a large bowl, beat the eggs just until yolks and whites are combined. Add milk, water, salt and melted butter, then add all the flour and beat with a wooden spoon or rotary beater until smooth. Leave batter for 1 hour at least before cooking. 

To make a filling, combine coconut with the jaggery which has been finely scraped with a knife or on a grater, or broken into pieces and pounded using a mortar and pestle. 

Grease a heavy pancake pan with butter or ghee, using just enough to give a thin film. Pour in a small ladle of the batter and swirl the pan to coat the base thinly. Cook over medium heat until golden brown on the underside. 

Turn pancake over and cook the other side for a few seconds. Turn onto a plate. Cook all the batter in this way, then fill each pancake with 2 tablespoons of the coconut filling and roll up. If liked, sprinkle with roughly chopped raw cashews. </Instructions>

Make sauce by simmering the ingredients, uncovered, for about 10 minutes, adding a little water if it becomes too thick. Slide in the omelette slices for the last 2 minutes of cooking. Serve with rice. </Instructions>

about 48 mint or basil leaves
lettuce leaves
shredded carrot and white radish


Clear sauce
4 tablespoons sugar
125 ml/4 fl oz/1/2 cup cold water
2 tablespoons fish sauce
finely sliced red and green chilli

<Name>Japanese Omelette</Name>
<Author>Encyclopedia of Asian Food</Author>
<Ingredients>3 eggs
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon sugar
2 tablespoons dashi or water
1 teaspoon mirin or sherry
1 teaspoon Japanese soy sauce
2 teaspoons oil
2 tablespoons cooked green peas
2 tablespoons finely diced cooked carrot
2 tablespoons grated white radish
few slices Japanese pickled ginger</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Beat eggs lightly till well mixed but not frothy. Stir in salt, sugar, dashi, mirin and soy sauce. 

A Japanese omelette pan is rectangular, but a round pan may be used and the omelette trimmed after it has been cooked and rolled. Heat the pan, rub with paper towels dipped in oil and pour in enough beaten egg to coat the pan. The pan should not be hot enough to brown the egg - Japanese omelettes are pale. 

Scatter in some peas and diced carrot as soon as the egg is set. Start rolling the omelette in a neat cylinder. Pour in more egg and when set, roll around the first omelette. Remove from pan, press firmly to shape. A bamboo sushi mat is useful for this. Allow to cool, then slice thickly with a sharp knife. Make a mound with the radish, place the ginger on top and serve alongside the omelette. </Instructions>

<Name>Cambodian Style Spring Rolls</Name>
<Author>Encyclopedia of Asian Food</Author>
<Ingredients>250 g/8 oz finely minced pork
250 g/8 oz fresh mung bean sprouts
1 cup soaked bean thread vermicelli
6 dried Chinese mushrooms
1 small onion, finely chopped
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon fish sauce
1 packet frozen spring roll pastry
oil for deep frying


Sauce
2 cloves garlic
1 1/2 tablespoons sugar
1 hot red chilli, seeded and chopped
5 tablespoons fish sauce
3 tablespoons boiling water
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon vinegar
3 tablespoons roasted crushed peanuts</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Put the pork and the washed, drained bean sprouts into a bowl. Cut soaked vermicelli into 5 cm (2 in) lengths. Soak dried mushrooms in hot water for 25 minutes, discard stems and slice caps finely. Combine all these ingredients with the onion, sugar, soy sauce and fish sauce, mixing thoroughly. 

If using small sheets, 125 mm (5 in) square, use one sheet per roll. If using large sheets 250 mm (10 in) square, cut in half. Take 2 teaspoons of the mixture and shape into a neat roll. Place at one end of the pastry square and roll up, turning ends in so the filling is completely enclosed. Deep fry in hot oil over medium heat, cooking the rolls for at least 2 minutes on each side so the filling is thoroughly cooked. Drain on paper towels and serve warm, accompanied by the dipping sauce. 

Sauce: Crush the garlic with some of the sugar. Combine with the chilli and fish sauce, leave for 10 minutes. Add the boiling water, lemon juice and vinegar and leave in a warm place for 30 minutes for flavours to mellow. Stir in the peanuts just before serving. </Instructions>

<Ingredients>5 eggs
375 ml/12 fl oz/1 1/2 cups cold water
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons oil
125 g/4 oz/1 cup plain (all-purpose) flour

Filling
4 tablespoons oil
2 cakes yellow bean curd, cut into strips
500 g/1 lb belly pork, boiled and diced
1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic
3 tablespoons salted soy beans, mashed or bean sauce
250 g/8 oz raw prawns
800 g/1 3/4 lb can bamboo shoot
drained and cut into matchstick strips
250 g/8 oz Chinese sweet turnip, peeled and cut into matchstick strips
1/2 teaspoon salt or to taste

Garnishes
1 large crisp lettuce
185 g/6 oz canned or frozen crab meat
250 g/8 oz bean sprouts
1 small cucumber
6 lap cheong (Chinese sausage) 
3 eggs
5 tablespoons finely chopped garlic
small bunch fresh coriander leaves
chilli sauce
dark soy sauce, sweetened, or kecap manis</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Egg roll wrappers: Beat eggs and water together until well mixed but not frothy. Add salt, oil and flour and beat until smooth. Allow to rest for 30 minutes while preparing a filling. Lightly oil a heavy frying pan or pancake pan with a piece of paper towels dipped in oil and rubbed over the heated pan. Pour in a small ladle of batter, swirl the pan quickly to make a very thin coating and pour any excess back into the container of batter. Cook over low heat until underside is cooked and pale golden. Turn and cook other side for a few seconds only. These wrappers should not be allowed to brown. Pile one on top of the other on a flat plate as they are cooked. 
Note: Batter may be made in an electric lender, putting in the liquid ingredients first, then the flour. Blend for just a few seconds, stop motor and scrape down sides of blender container, then blend for a further few seconds. This batter must be allowed to rest for a longer time. If there is still froth on top when ready to cook the wrappers, spoon it off before starting to cook. 

Filling: Heat oil in a wok and fry the strips of bean curd until golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Cut into small dice. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of oil from the wok, add the diced pork and fry, until the fat begins to run. Add the garlic and mashed soy beans and fry, stirring, until the garlic begins to smell cooked. Add the shelled, deveined and chopped raw prawns and toss until the prawns change colour. Add the bamboo shoot and sweet turnip and fry, stirring and tossing, until cooked but still crisp, then add the bean curd. Sprinkle with salt and mix. Simmer uncovered in the wok until filling is almost dry.Taste and add more salt if necessary. Invert a small bowl inside a larger bowl and put the filling on this so that any liquid or oil can drain away under the small bowl. 

Garnishes: Wash lettuce well, separating the leaves. With a stainless steel knife remove the thick leaf rib and cut each leaf into 2 or 3 pieces lengthways. Blot lettuce gently on paper towels and pile leaves on a plate. Flake the crab meat, removing any bits of bony tissue. Put into a small bowl. Pinch straggly &apos;tails&apos; off bean sprouts, wash well, scald by pouring boiling water over, and refresh in a bowl of iced water. Drain well, pile into a bowl. Peel and seed cucumber, then cut into strips. Steam the lap cheong in a colander for 10 minutes, then cut into thin slices. Put into a bowl and keep warm. Beat the eggs, season with salt and pepper, and fry in a lightly oiled frying pan to make 4 or 5 very thin omelettes. Do not fold. Turn onto a plate as they are done. When cool, roll up and cut into thin strips. Put into a bowl. 

To make crisp fried garlic which is one of the important additions, finely chop garlic, or bruise using a mortar and pestle. Rinse garlic in cold water, drain well in fine sieve, then wrap in paper towels and squeeze gently to remove as much moisture as possible. Heat about 4 tablespoons oil in a small pan and fry the garlic over low heat, stirring constantly, until it starts to turn golden. Remove pan from heat at once, before it starts to brown. Garlic will finish cooking in the stored heat of the oil. When cool remove from oil and drain on paper towels. Put into a small bowl. 

Wash fresh coriander leaves very well, dry on paper towels, then chop fairly fine. Put into a small bowl. Put chilli sauce into a small bowl. In another bowl mix dark soy sauce with a little sugar to sweeten. 

Have all the garnishes ready before starting to cook the egg roll wrappers and the filling. 

To serve: Each person puts an egg roll wrapper on his or her plate. On this goes a piece of lettuce leaf, which is spread with chilli sauce or sprinkled with the sweetened soy. Roll up the egg wrapper,turning in the sides so that the filling is completely enclosed. </Instructions>

<Name>Spring Onion (Scallion) Pancakes</Name>
<Author>Encyclopedia of Asian Food</Author>
<Ingredients>250 g/8 oz/2 cups all-purpose flour
190 ml/6 fl oz/3/4 cup boiling water, 
plus 1 tablespoon extra
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon oriental sesame oil
salt to taste
4 spring onions (scallions), finely chopped
oil for shallow frying</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Place flour in a bowl. Measure the boiling water and pour over flour, stir with a spoon to moisten all the flour and, as soon as cool enough to handle, knead hard for 10 minutes until smooth. Form a ball, wrap in plastic and let dough rest for at least 30 minutes. 

Form dough into a roll and divide into 6 equal portions. Roll each portion on a lightly floured surface into thin pancakes about 25 cm (10 in) in diameter. Combine both kinds of oil, and brush some on top of pancake. Sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 2 teaspoons chopped spring onions. Roll pancake like a Swiss roll, press ends to seal and coil up the roll like a snail. Tuck the end into the middle. Flatten with the hand, then roll once again on a lightly floured surface to a smaller pancake than the first, about 12 cm (5 in) in diameter and 6 mm (1/4 in) thick. Repeat until all the pancakes are rolled. 

Heat a heavy frying pan and add a tablespoon of oil. When hot add 1 pancake, turn heat low and cover pan with lid. Cook for 2 minutes, then turn pancake over and cover for a further 2 minutes or until pancake is golden brown on both sides. Do not have heat too high or the pancakes will brown before the centre is cooked. Pressing centre of pancake with a frying spatula helps it to brown evenly. Cut pancakes into 6 triangular pieces. Serve warm. </Instructions>

<Notes>These are crisp and brown on the outside, flavoured with salt and spring onions. Serve as a savoury hors d&apos;oeuvre, or to accompany rice porridge. Traditionally they might be made with melted lard, but I prefer to use a light vegetable oil mixed with oriental sesame oil with its wonderful toasted sesame flavour. </Notes>

<Ingredients>1/2 cup soaked bean thread vermicelli
2 shallots, finely chopped
6 spring onions (scallions), finely chopped
250 g/8 oz pork mince
185 g/6 oz crab meat, frozen or canned
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon fish sauce
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
12 Chinese spring roll wrappers 
or 24 rice paper sheets
oil for deep frying
lettuce leaves
fresh mint, Vietnamese mint
or coriander leaves
strips of cucumber
nuoc cham</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Soak a small skein (approx. 50 g) of bean thread vermicelli in hot water for 10 minutes, then drain and measure. Cut noodles into 2.5 cm (1 in) lengths. Put into a bowl with the shallots, spring onions, pork, flaked crab meat, salt, fish sauce and pepper. Mix well. 

If using small sheets, 125 mm (5 in) square, use 1 sheet per roll. If using large sheets, 250 mm (10 in) square, cut in half. Put 2 teaspoons of filling at one end. Roll up tightly, folding in the sides so the filling is completely enclosed. Moisten edge of wrapper with a little water or egg white to help it stick. If using rice paper, brush sheets with lukewarm water in which a teaspoon of sugar has been dissolved. Besides making the sheets pliable, the sugar helps the rolls to brown. 

When all the rolls are made, heat oil in a wok and fry a few at a time on medium heat until golden. Oil should not be too hot or the filling will not cook through. Drain on paper towels. 

To serve: Wrap each roll in a lettuce leaf including a small sprig of Vietnamese mint, coriander or parsley and a strip of cucumber. Dip in nuoc cham and eat immediately. </Instructions>

<Ingredients>200 g/7 oz/1 cup uncooked rice
4 tablespoons cooked rice
90 g/3 oz/1 cup freshly grated coconut
pinch of salt
1 tablespoon sugar
750 ml/1 1/2 pints/3 cups boiling water
oil

Topping
125 ml/4 fl oz thick coconut milk
2 tablespoons sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 spring onion (scallion), chopped
2 tablespoons corn kernels
2 tablespoons pounded dried shrimp</Ingredients>
<Instructions>Put first 6 ingredients into a bowl, pour the boiling water over and leave to get cold. Blend at high speed in an electric blender until very finely ground. Mix the coconut milk, sugar and salt together and reserve. 

Heat the indented pan and brush with oil. With a ladle, pour rice mixture into each hollow, to almost fill. Cook over low heat or in a hot oven, 220 degrees C (425 degrees F), until firm. Top each with 1 teaspoon of the coconut milk mixture. Add a sprinkling of chopped spring onion, a few corn kernels, or some dried shrimp powder and finish by cooking for a further 1-2 minutes. Run a small spatula between the pan and each cake to loosen, and if the outside is well browned and crisp, remove to a wire rack. Serve warm. </Instructions>
<Serves>24</Serves>
<Notes>These creamy rice cakes are baked in a clay pan with small round indentations, placed over glowing coals. The size and shape of the indentations are similar to the iron pan used for gem scones, or an aebelskiver pan which Danish cooks use and which is probably more common in Europe and the United States. The heavy iron pans may be placed over a gas flame or electric hotplate. A convenient modern appliance is an electric doughnut cooker which offers the small round shapes and does the job perfectly. </Notes>
