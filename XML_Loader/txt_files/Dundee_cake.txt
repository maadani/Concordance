110 g  Currants, cleaned
1 ts Baking powder
110 g  Raisins, cleaned and stoned
225 g  Caster sugar
50 g  Mixed peel, chopped

75 g  Glace cherries, chopped
1 tb Sherry
50 g  Ground almonds

250 g  Plain flour                                  
Grated rind of 1 lemon
Instructions:
(For a 18cm-cake tin)
  
  Grease and line the base and sides of the tin and grease the paper lining.
  
  Mix the sultanas, currants, raisins, peel, cherries and ground almonds
  together.
  
  Beat the butter until it is soft and creamy then add the caster sugar and
  beat the mixture with the lemon rind until light and fluffy in both colour
  and texture. Beat the eggs together then add them gradually to the creamed
  mixture, beating well between each addition. Sift together the flour and
  baking powder and lightly stir it into the creamed mixture with the sherry
  and all the dried fruit.
  
  Turn the mixture into the tin, spread it to the sides and slightly hollow
  out the centre, then cover the surface with the almonds.
  
  Bake the cake at 160 oC (325 oF) for 2.5 - 3 hours or until a warm skewer
  pushed into the mixture comes out clean.
  
  Cool the cake in the tin for 15 minutes then turn it out onto a wire tray
  to cool completely.
