Ingredients:
8 oz Presoaked Chinese mushrooms

1 ts Finely chopped galangal 
1 ts Finely chopped lemon grass 
1 ts Kaffir lime leaf -(finely chopped) 
2 Coriander roots 
4 sm Garlic cloves - coarsely chopped 
1/2 ts Curry powder 
1 tb Light soy sauce 
2 tb Sugar 
1 ts Powdered coriander seed 
1 ts Ground cumin 
1 ts Salt 
2 tb Oil 
1/2 c Coconut milk 

THE PEANUT SAUCE: 
1 tb Oil 
1 tb Red curry paste 
1 c Coconut milk 
2 tb Sugar 
1/4 ts Salt 
1 tb Lemon juice 
3 tb Ground roast peanuts 
Instructions:
Taking each mushroom as a rough circle cut towards centre in a spiral to make one long strip as if peeling an apple in one go. Set aside. 
THE MARINADE: In a mortar pound together the galangal, lemon grass, lime leaf, coriander roots and garlic to form a paste. Place this in a mixing bowl and stir in all the other ingredients, mixing well. Place all the mushroom strips in this marinade and leave for at least 30 minutes. 
PEANUT SAUCE: In a wok or frying pan/skillet, heat the oil, add the curry paste and fry briefly until it blends with the oil. Add the coconut milk, lower the heat and stir well until a rich red colour appears. Add the remaining ingredients, stirring constantly until a thick sauce is formed, and set aside. 
Take the mushroom strips from the marinade and thread each one on to a satay stick. Grill/broil until cooked through. Serve with the peanut sauce and fresh cucumber pickle. Little triangles of toast may also be served for those who wish to mop up more sauce.
