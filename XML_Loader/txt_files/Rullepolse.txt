Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds lean boneless top round steak 
1 teaspoon salt 
1 teaspoon ground allspice 
1/2 teaspoon white pepper 
1/4 cup minced onion 
1 pound pork tenderloin 
8 cups water 
13 3/4 ounce can beef broth 
1 tablespoon pickling spice 
  Leaf lettuce 

Instructions:
Place steak between 2 sheets of plastic wrap, and flatten to 1/4 inch thickness, using a meat mallet or rolling pin. Sprinkle steak evenly with salt, allspice, pepper and onion. Place pork on narrow end of steak, and roll steak around it. Secure at 2 inch intervals with heavy string. Place, seam side down, in a large Dutch oven. Add water, broth, and pickling spice; cover and bake at 350 degrees for 3 hours or until tender.
Remove from cooking liquids; let cool, and wrap in heavy duty plastic wrap. Discard cooking liquid. Place wrapped meat in an 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 x 3 inch loaf dish. Place a weight on top of meat (a foil wrapped brick works well). Chill 8 hours. Remove string; cut into 1/4 inch thick slices. Arrange on lettuce lined plate, if desired.
