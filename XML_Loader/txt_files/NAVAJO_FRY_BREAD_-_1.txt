Ingredients:
4 cups all purpose flour
1 tablespoon double-acting baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups warm water
1 cup vegetable shortening

Instructions:
In a bowl whisk together the flour, the baking powder, and the salt, stir in the
water, and knead the mixture on a floured surface until it
forms a soft but not sticky dough. Let the dough stand, covered with a kitchen
towel, for 15 minutes. Pull off egg-size pieces of the dough
and pat and stretch them into 1/4-inch thick rounds. Poke a hole with a finger
through the center of each round so that the breads will
fry evenly. In a large heavy skillet heat the shortening over moderately high heat
until it is hot but not smoking, in it fry the rounds, 1 at
a time, for 2 minutes on each side, or until they are golden, and transfer the
breads as they are fried to paper towels to drain.
