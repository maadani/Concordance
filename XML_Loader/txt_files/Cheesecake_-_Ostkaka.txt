Ingredients: 
12 litre milk 
0.3 litre all-purpose flour 
1 tablespoon rennet 
1 litre cream 
6 eggs 
250 grammes granulated sugar 
200 grammes almonds 
10 pieces bitter almonds 

Instructions:
Proceed as follows:
Heat the milk to 37 oC (100 oF). Add the all-purpose flour and the rennet. Stir until the mixture thickens. 
Let it stand until it separates into cheese and whey. Stir a few times so that the cheese separates from the whey. 
Strain the mixture and make certain virtually all of the whey is removed. 
Stir cream, granulated sugar, eggs and finely chopped almonds and bitter almonds into the "cheese". 
Pour the mixture into suitable buttered forms. Place the forms in a water bath and bake them at low heat in the oven (175 oC, 350 oF.) until the mixture solidifies and acquires a light brown colour

Notes:
"Ostkaka", cheesecake, is a traditional dish from the province of Sm√•land in southern Sweden. Swedes normally do not prepare the dish themselves but buy it ready-made. However, "ostkaka" is not easily available outside Sweden; hence we have included a recipe (which should serve 15-20 persons as a dessert) for those who would like to try.
