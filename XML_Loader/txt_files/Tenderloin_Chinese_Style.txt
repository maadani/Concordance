Ingredients:
1 lb. beef tenderloin
3 T dry sherry
1½ T soy sauce
2 t oyster sauce
1 t sugar
1 t cornstarch
½ t baking soda
¼ t salt
1 clove garlic, crushed
1½ T vegetable oil
2 medium yellow onions, thinly sliced

Instructions:
Remove and discard fat from meat. Cut meat across the grain into thin slices.

Combine sherry, soy sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, cornstarch, baking soda, salt and garlic in a medium glass bowl. Mix in meat. Cover and refrigerate at least 3 hours.

Heat oil in wok over high heat. Stir-fry onions in the oil until golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer onions to a serving plate. Keep warm.

Add about 1/3 of the meat to wok, spreading out slices so they do not overlap. Cook slices on each side just until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove meat from pan and arrange over onion slices. Repeat twice to cook remaining meat.
