Ingredients:
Pastry for 1 (9") crust (recipe below) 
1 pound ground beef 
1 teaspoon salt 
1/2 teaspoon ground oregano 
1/4 teaspoon pepper 
1/2 cup fine dry Italian style bread crumbs 
1/2 cup tomato sauce 
1 onion, very finely diced 
1 green pepper, very finely diced 
  Cheese Topping (recipe below) 
2 cups mashed potatoes 
1/2 cup finely shredded mild cheddar cheese 
Cheese Topping:   
1 egg 
1/4 cup milk 
1/2 teaspoon salt 
1/2 teaspoon dry mustard 
1/2 teaspoon worcestershire sauce 
1 1/2 cups finely shredded mild cheddar cheese 
Pie Crust:   
1 1/2 cups flour 
1/2 cup shortening 
1/2 teaspoon salt 
7 tablespoons cold water 

Instructions:
Heat oven to 425.

Prepare pastry (directions below).

In skillet, cook and stir ground beef, onion and green peppers until done. Drain fat. Stir in salt, oregano, pepper, crumbs, 1/2 c. tomato sauce. Mix well. Pour into pastry lined pan. Spread Cheese Topping (recipe below) evenly over filling. Then cover with mash potatoes. Sprinkle mash potatoes with 1/2 c. shredded cheese. Cover edge with 2-3" strips of aluminum foil to prevent excessive browning, removing foil for the last 15 minutes of baking. Bake about 30 minutes. Cut into wedges and serve.

Pastry: Mix flour & salt. Cut in shortening until well blended. Add cold water 1 tablespoon at a time. When dough will hold together, roll out on a floured surface. Place in 9" pie pan.

Cheese topping: Mix egg & milk. Add salt, dry mustard and worcestershire sauce. Mix well. Add cheese. Mix well. Pour over meat mixture.

Variations: You can use a bought piecrust if so desired. Also this is a good way to use leftover mash potatoes. We love to make mash potatoes with hot pepper cheese. This would be very good on top of the meat mixture. Just add about 8 oz. of cubed hot pepper cheese in your potatoes when you are mashing them. Just use your imagination.
