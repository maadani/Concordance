Ingredients:
1 ts Oil 
1 lb Ground pork 
4 -to 
8 Garlic cloves - finely chopped 
3 Green onions, white part - chopped 
3/4 c Roasted salted peanuts 
1 Fresh pineapple; -OR- 
5 -Tangerines, -OR- 
4 -Oranges 
1/3 c Sugar 
1/2 ts Pepper 
Lettuce leaves 
Mint or coriander leaves 
Chopped chilis 
Instructions:
Grind peanuts. Heat oil in a frying pan, add pork, garlic and onions. Cook until pink color disappears. Drain off most of the fat. Add sugar and pepper, cook 1-2 minutes. Add peanuts, mix in well, then remove from heat. Cool to room temperature. 
Prepare platter, lining with lettuce leaves. Peel and segment the citrus fruit if used, cutting each segment down to the back and fanning open to form a circle. If using pineapple, cut off top leaves and outer skin, as thinly as possible, from top down. Look at the "eye" pattern, as it forms a spiral down the pineapple. Cut the spirals with a sharp knife held at about a 45 degree angle. Cut off bottom. Cut pineapple into about 5 or 6 wedges and then cut each of those into 1/4 inch slices. Arrange fruit on platter. 
Mound meat mixture onto fruit, and decorate with other garnishes. Serve at room temperature, or chilled.
