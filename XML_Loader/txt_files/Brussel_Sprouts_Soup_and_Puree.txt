Notes:
Two days before Christmas 1998 the Swedish daily Svenska Dagbladet published a recipe for a Brussel sprouts soup. After all, Christmas is the time for cabbage type dishes in Sweden. We played around with the recipe and not only modified it but also found that if you eliminate most of the liquid, you end up with a delicious vegetable puree.
