Ingredients: 
300 grams freshly cooked mussels 
l00 grams pine nuts 
25 grams garlic 
olive oil 
Instructions:
Proceed as follows:
Chop the garlic and the pine nuts briefly in the food processor. Heat some extra virgin olive oil in a pan and add the coarse pine nut - garlic mixture. 
Roast the mixture until it just begins to aquire a golden brown colour (usually 2-3 minutes) and let it cool. 
Purée the cooked mussels and the roasted pine nut-garlic mixture in the food processor. If possible, use freshly prepared mussels which have been cooked together with white wine, fennel, celery, leeks and carrots. 
The pine nut-garlic-mussel purée can be served as it is, on toast or crackers, or (our preference because of the eggs!) as an omelette filling. In the latter case, a glass (or two) of dry cider is a perfect accompaniment.

Notes:
Roasting will not destroy the aphrodisiac qualities of pine nut and can in some combinations enhance the taste. Keep in mind, though, that pine nuts roast quickly in comparison to other nuts and also burn easily.
