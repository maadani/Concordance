Ingredients: 
1 ripe pineapple 
600 grams of our fish stew (or of yours!) 
50-75 grams grated cheese 
paprika powder 

Instructions:
Proceed as follows:
Prepare the fish stew. 
Preheat the oven to 225 oC (400 oF). 
Cut the pineapple vertically into two halves and scoop out the fruit flesh. 
Mix the fish stew with some of the fruit flesh. How much you take is a matter of taste; we normally use one third (and have the remainder for dessert). 
Fill the two pineapple halves with the hot (or, at least, warm) fish stew. 
Cover with the grated cheese and some paprika powder. 
Place the fille pineapple halves on a plate and put it in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. After that, raise the thermostat setting and turn on the grill element. Grill until the cheese has melted and turned golden brown. 
Serve! 
Any thick fish stew can be used. "Watery" stews of the bouillabaisse type are less well suited. As a drink, we recommend beer. For once, white wine does not come well together a fish dish.

Notes:
We came across this dish when we spent two weeks at White Sands hotel, 20 kms north of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. We found it so delicious that we had it three times during that period. Back in the Netherlands, of course we started to try to copy the dish.
If you can get hold of a really ripe and succulent pineapple, we believe our copy is as good as the original. When eating it, you start to dream of the beach at the Indian Ocean...
