Ingredients:
1/2 c Corn oil 
5 md (4 cups) onions, chopped 
4 lb Baby lamb, cut into 3-in pieces, including bone 
2 lb Carrots, cut into thin julienne slices, 2-" long 
1 c Dark or light raisins 
1 c Pistachio nuts, shelled (optional but recommended 
3  Heads garlic, cloves separated but not peeled, rinsed in water 
4 c Raw rice, well rinsed 
3 1/2 c ;water, warm 
2 ts ;salt, or to taste 
1 ts ;pepper 

Instructions:
1. Heat oil in pan large enough to contain all ingreds. Add onions & stir-fry over moderate heat for 2 mins. Add meat & brown for abt 15 mins. Remove the meat & onions to platter or a bowl. The balance of the oil remains in the pan.

2. Cover the bottom of the pan w/half the carrots to protect meat from scorching. Over this, arrange the meat & onions. Cover w/ the balance of the carrots. Sprinkle w/pistachios & garlic cloves over all.

3. Add the rice to cover other ingreds & carefully pour in water, salt, & pepper. Bring the liquid to a boil & simmer for abt 10 mins, or until the liquid is absorbed by the rice. Stir top of rice lightly to mix but do not disturb other ingreds. Turn heat to low, cover the pan, & cook for abt 1 hr w/out stirring.

Serve the polo w/salads, pickles, & Afghan bread

VARIATION: The polo can be prepared w/chicken & boneless beef chuck or ribs of beef. Stir-fry 15 pieces of chicken (legs, thighs, & breast) or 4 lbs beef, w/onions as in the basic recipes; all other steps are the same. The beef will take longer to tenderize & it is suggested that it be cooked w/onions in a covered pan for 20 mins before moving on to the next steps.
