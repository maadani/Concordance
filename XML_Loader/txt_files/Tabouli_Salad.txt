Ingredients:
1/3 cup bulgur wheat 
2 clove garlic crushed 
3 whole lemons juice 
1 bunch mint fresh 
8 bunch parsley large bunches,8 cups chopped 
4 whole scallions both white and green parts sliced thin 
3 whole tomatoes ripe, diced 
salt to taste 
black pepper freshly ground , to taste 
olive oil optional, highly recommended for taste. Tablespoon to a quarter cup 



Instructions:
Cover bulgur with warm water and soak for 15 minutes. Squeeze out excess water. Mix in the lemon juice, crushed garlic , salt and pepper. Allow this to rest until bulgur is soft, about 30 minutes.

Wash the mint and parsley well and dry it. Chop parsley and mint finely using a knife or food processor (if using a food processor it helps to use the pulse in order to prevent chopping to fine and turning the herbs to a puree).

Combine the mint, parsley, scallions and tomatoes and bulgur mixture . Toss with olive oil as desired. Add lemon juice,salt or pepper as desired to adjust the taste.

Serve with small romaine lettuce leaves, use them as scoops.

The best salad in the world, as far as my mom is concerned. Extremely healthy. Great on a hot summers day.
