Ingredients:
1 1/2 pound middle or best end lamb
2 kidneys (optional)
pepper and salt
1 or 2 carrots
1 piece of turnip
8 oz onions (or chopped leeks)
1 pound peeled and sliced potatoes dripping

Instructions:
Cut meat into neat pieces and dust with pepper and salt.
Put into casserole layers of meat and vegetables with such extra seasonings required. Finish with a layer of thickly sliced potatoes, overlapping. Pour in about 1/2 to 3/4 pint water - sufficient to come about one-third of the way up the casserole - and cover top with little dabs of  dripping. Cover casserole and put into a fairly slow oven (275 to 300 degrees F) for about 3 hours. Uncover casserole about half an hour before, raise oven heat and brown the  top layer of potatoes.

Notes:
This recipe is from an "old" (1963) British cookbook called
the "A to Z of cookery".
