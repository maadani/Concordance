Ingredients:
9 inch ( 23 cm) homemade or purchased deep-dish pie crust 
4 eggs, separated 
1-1/2 cups ( 375 mL) brown sugar 
1/3 cup ( 75 mL) all-purpose flour 
1/4 cup ( 50 mL) melted butter 
5 cups ( 1.25 L) fresh or frozen rhubarb pieces, about 1/2 inch (1 cm) thick 
1 pinch cream of tartar 
1/3 cup ( 75 mL) brown sugar 

Instructions:
1. Place one oven rack on the lowest level and one just above the centre. Preheat oven to 425 F (220 C). Line pie plate with homemade crust. Or drop purchased crust, still in foil pan, into a glass pie plate. This produces a crisper crust and makes it easier to handle a finished pie. Separate eggs, placing whites in a very clean (even a hint of fat will prevent whites from whipping) medium-size mixing bowl. Set aside while continuing with recipe. 

2. In a large mixing bowl, stir 1-1/2 cups brown sugar with flour. Stir in yolks and butter until blended. Stir in rhubarb. When mixed, turn into pie shell. Smooth top. Bake, uncovered, on lowest oven rack for 10 minutes. Then, without opening oven door, reduce heat to 350F (180C) and continue baking until filling is bubbly and golden-topped like a butter tart, from 45 to 50 minutes. Remove to a cooling rack. 

3. Using an electric mixer, beat egg whites and cream of tartar until soft moist peaks form when beaters are lifted, about 1 minute. While continuing to beat, gradually crumble in 1/3 cup brown sugar. Beat until stiff shiny peaks form when beaters are lifted, about 1 to 2 minutes. Immediately turn mixture onto warm pie filling. Using the back of a large spoon, gently spread meringue so it covers filling and a portion of the pastry to form a seal. Do not press down, but gently swirl surface forming small peaks. Place on centre rack of 350F (180C) oven and bake until meringue is golden-tipped, about 6 minutes. Remove from oven and cool on a rack. Because of the meringue, it's best to serve as soon as possible, but pie will keep well at room temperature for up to 1 day. For a party, bake filled crust ahead. Just before serving, add meringue and bake.

Notes:
Aunt Dianne gave this wonderful recipe for brown sugar meringue-topped rhubarb pie to her niece Dianne Almond of Hamilton, Ont., thus producing a family heritage recipe. It now makes a command performance for holidays and Almond family get-togethers throughout the year.
