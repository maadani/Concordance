Ingredients:
1 ham steak, 1 1/2 to 2 pounds 
1 tablespoon butter or margarine 
1/2 cup finely diced carrots 
1 teaspoon dried sage leaves 
3/4 cup apple juice concentrate 
1/2 cup water 

Instructions:
1. Trim ham steak of all fat around the edges.
2. Heat the butter in a large, heavy skillet. Brown the ham on each side. Remove to plate.
3. Briefly saute the carrots. Stir in the sage, apple juice concentrate and water.
4. Bring to a boil. Lower to a gentle simmer. Cover. Cook about 10 minutes until carrots are almost tender.
5. Return the ham steak to the skillet. Place in a 400 degree oven, uncovered.
6. Baste and cook for 20 to 30 minutes, depending on thickness of steak.
7. Serve ham spooned with the cider sauce. Or, if desired, remove ham to platter. Reduce the cider sauce over high heat before spooning over ham. The flavor will become a little more pronounced.

Notes:
A large cast-iron skillet works well for this recipe. They brown well, hold the heat and can go directly into the oven.
1/4 cup of chopped parsley can be added to ham before baking. Sprinkle over top. The parsley enhances the flavor.
