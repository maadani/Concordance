Ingredients:
Ingredients for Strudel crumbs: 
1/2 cup brown sugar 
1/2 cup flour 
1/2 cup chopped pecans or walnuts 
1 Tbsp. Butter 
Mix together until crumbly and set aside. 
Ingredients for Muffins: 
2 cups sifted flour 
1/4 cup sugar 
1 Tbsp. baking powder 
1/2 tsp. salt 
1/2 baking soda 
1 beaten egg 
1/4 cup orange juice 
3/4 cup milk 
1/4 cooking oil 
Grated peel from one orange 
3/4 cup whole berry cranberry sauce. 

Instructions:
Sift dry ingredients together for muffins and place in a mixing bowl. Blend egg, milk, peel, juice and oil in a small bowl. Make a well in the flour mixture and pour milk mixture into the well all at once. Mix ingredients only until moist. Batter will still be lumpy. Lightly fold in cranberry sauce. Use the jumbo muffin tins if at all possible. Grease tin or use paper liner. Fill each muffin slot 1/3 full of batter. Sprinkle some of the Strudel crumbs on batter. Place batter on top to fill muffin 2/3 full. Sprinkle more crumbs on top of the muffin. If you like more topping double the recipe for crumb mixture. Bake at 425 degrees for small muffins and 375 for large or Jumbo muffins. Approximate time for small muffins is 20 to 25 minutes and large muffins 30 to 35 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. This recipe is similar to the purchased package mix but better of course!
