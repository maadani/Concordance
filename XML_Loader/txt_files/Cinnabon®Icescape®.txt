Notes:
In a blender, Cinnabon adds concentrated flavoring, some ice and a curious secret ingredient referred to only as a "dairy product." When blended smooth, out comes these thick, refreshing drinks that look and taste like they were made with ice cream. For this clone we just need a little half-and-half (that's half cream and half milk for those of you across the pond). It gives this version the exact same creamy consistency as the original with its custom "dairy" ingredient. Strawberry is the most popular of the flavors, but the other two are tasty as well. The Mochalatta version uses the TSR clone of the Mochalatta Chill from last week and produces as thicker blended version of the drink, similar to Starbuck's popular blended Frappuccino.
