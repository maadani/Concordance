Instructions:
CAKE:
Beat eggs, sugar, and vanilla together until thick and fluffy, about 10 minutes.  Alternately fold chocolate and flour into the egg mixture, ending with flour.  Pour the batter into 3 8-inch cake pans that have been well greased and floured.  Bake in a preheated 350 degree F. oven for 10
to 15 minutes or until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean.  Cool cakes in pans for 5 minutes; turn out on racks to cool completely.

SYRUP:
Make syrup by mixing together sugar and water and boiling for 5 minutes. When syrup has cooled, stir in kirsch.  Prick the cake layers and pour syrup over all 3 layers.

FILLING:
To make the butter-cream filling, beat together sugar and butter until   well blended.  Add egg yolk; beat until light and fluffy, about 3 to 5 minutes.  Fold in Kirsch.

CAKE ASSEMBLY:
To assemble cake, place 1 layer on a cake plate.  Spread with butter cream   filling.  Using 3/4 cup of the cherries, which have been patted dry, drop   cherries evenly over cream.  Place second layer on cake.  Repeat.  Place   third layer on top.  Fold 2 T confectioners' sugar into the whipped cream.
Cover the sides and top of the cake with whipped cream.  Decorate top of   cake with remaining 1/2 cup cherries.  To make chocolate curls from   chocolate bar, shave (at room temperature) with a vegetable peeler. 
Refrigerate curls until ready to use.  Press chocolate curls on sides of cake and sprinkle a few on the top.  Chill until serving time.
