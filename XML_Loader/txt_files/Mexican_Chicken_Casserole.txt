Ingredients:
1 whole chicken (or 4-5 chicken breasts) 
8 corn tortillas 
2 cans Cream of Chicken or Mushroom Soup 
1 or 2 cans Ro-tel Tomatoes w/Chilis, drained 
2 cups (475 ml) cheddar cheese, grated 
sour cream (optional) 

Instructions:
Boil the chicken until completely done, let cool, remove from bone, and shred or dice into bite sized pieces. 
Warm the tortillas (just to make flexible) by placing in a skillet with a small amount of oil. 
Spray a 9 x 13 inch casserole dish with Pam and line with the warmed tortillas. 
Place the chicken on top of the tortillas. 
Put the soup (I use one of each kind) and Ro-tel Tomatoes in a blender and mix. 
Pour the soup mixture over the chicken and top with cheese. 
Bake in a 350 degree (175 C.) oven for approximately 45 minutes or until cheese is melted and the soup bubbles around the edges.

Notes:
You may want to vary the amount of Ro-tel you use, especially if you have children - 2 cans may be too spicy. I usually serve with spanish rice and beans. We also top with sour cream (on the plate, not in the pan).
