Ingredients: 
500 grams yellow split peas 
1.5 - 2 litres of water or vegetable bouillon (can be made from bouillon cubes!) 
2 finely chopped onions 
20 - 30 grams of fresh, whole ginger 
5 - 10 grams of majoram or thyme or both 
optional: potatoes 
optional: carrots 
optional: 500 grams of diced bacon 

Instructions:
Proceed as follows:
Soak the yellow split peas in water for at least 12 hours. Discard the water (even though some insist you should use this water for the soup). 
Boil the peas, bouillon, onion and ginger for at least 90 minutes. Now and then, carefully skim off the pea hulls as they float up to the surface. When 15 - 30 minutes remain of the cooking time, add the majoram and/or thyme. 
The optional ingredients should be added at a late stage during the cooking. Potatoes and carrots will require 20 - 25 minutes of cooking, the bacon at least 30 minutes 
Taste, add salt if required. 
The pea soup is often served together with some mustard. A very (old) Swedish tradition is also to serve it together with hot punsch, an arrak-based, intensely sweet liquor. However, beer will do fine as a substitute.

Notes:
During centuries, the pea soup prepared from yellow split peas was served every Thursday. Only during the second half of the 20th century has this tradition begun to disappear. The pea soup is best when cooked on very large scale; thus, the version served in the Army has a well-deserved good reputation since it is normally cooked in 200 litres batches. But you might want to try it on a somewhat smaller scale...
