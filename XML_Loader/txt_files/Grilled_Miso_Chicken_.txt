1 teaspoon minced ginger root

Miso marinade adds a rich flavor to this country-style grilled chicken. Thigh meat stays moist and tender, but boned chicken breasts are delicious, too. The chicken can be sautéed in a skillet

Blend soy sauce, saké, mirin, miso, green onions, ginger root and garlic in a rectangular baking dish. Coat chicken with mixture. Marinate 1 hour or refrigerate overnight, turning several times. 

Preheat a hibichi, portable tabletop grill or charcoal grill. Shake marinade off chicken; pat dry. Place skin-down on hot grill. Grill 4 to 5 minutes. Turn chicken; grill second side 4 to 5 minutes or until golden brown and done inside. When chicken is done, sprinkle with sesame seeds and spice mixture.
