Notes:
Probably chili con carne was the first Mexican recipe we tried to modify according to our own taste. The objective was to develop a dish that could readily be prepared from easy-to-store ingredients (except for the minced meat). The jalapeño peppers? They can be kept deep frozen and be used as required. But deseed them first, they can then be put directly into the food processor without thawing.
