Ingredients:
3 pounds lean boneless lamb, cut into 1 1/2 inch cubes 
36 dried apricots 
2 medium onions cut into 1 1/2 inch squares 
4 medium red bell peppers, seeded and cut into 1 1/2 inch squares 
6 cups hot cooked couscous 
Orange-Rosemary Sauce   
1 teaspoon grated orange peel 
2/3 cup orange juice 
3 tablespoons olive oil or salad oil 
3 tablespoons white wine vinegar 
2 tablespoons soy sauce 
1 1/4 teaspoons crushed dry rosemary 
1/2 cup minced shallots 
2 cloves garlic (minced) 
1/8 teaspoon pepper 

Instructions:
Prepare Orange-Rosemary Sauce. Add lamb and apricots to sauce; stir to coat. Cover; refrigerate at least 4 hours, stirring several times. Lift meat and apricots from sauce and drain briefly (reserve sauce). On 12 sturdy metal skewers, thread meat alternately with apricots, onion, and bell peppers. Place skewers on a lightly greased grill 4 to 6 inches above medium coals. Cook, turning occasionally and basting frequently with sauce, until meat is well browned on outside but still pink in center (12 to 15 minutes). Serve with couscous. 12 servings.

Orange-Rosemary Sauce: In large bowl, stir together orange peel, orange juice, olive oil, vinegar, soy sauce, rosemary, shallots, garlic and pepper.
