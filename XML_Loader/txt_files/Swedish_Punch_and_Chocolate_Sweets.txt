Ingredients: 
300 ml granulated sugar 
2 eggs 
300 g coconut butter 
100 g cocoa powder 
100 ml Swedish arrak punch 

Instructions:
Proceed as follows:
Beat the eggs into the sugar. 
Melt the coconut butter, then let it cool until it almost starts to resolidify. 
Pour the melted cocnut butter into the egg-and-sugar batter, mix. 
Add the cocoa powder and the punch, stir until you get a homogenous mixture. 
Pour the mixture onto a wide dish or baking-tin. This should be so large that the resulting layer is not more than 1 cm deep. 
Leave it in the refrigerator to solidify. Afterwards, cut it up into small pieces, which can be covered by sprinkles or jimmies for easier handling. 
The punch and chocolate sweets must be stored in a cool place. The softening point for the coconut butter-punch mixture is around room temperature.

Notes:
For many years these deliciously fattening sweets were served at Christmas time in our family. Any dietist would scream blue murder after reading the recipe, since they come loaded with cholesterol-raising saturated fat. But they are sooooo delicious, so once a year you should be permitted to indulge in them
