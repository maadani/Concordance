Ingredients:
2 lg (abt 1/4 lb ea) onions, 
  -peeled 
4 c Water 
1 ts Salt 
1/2 lb Ground beef 
3 tb Raw rice, rinsed, cooked until very soft, drained, & mashed 
1 ts Salt 
1/4 ts Pepper 
1/4 ts Ground cuminseed 
10 md Pitted prunes, cut lengthwise into halves 
2 tb Corn oil 

Instructions:
1. Make a 1/2-inch deep incision into side of each onion. Bring water & salt to a boil over moderate heat & drop in onions. Cook for 2 mins, turning them w/slotted spoon during that time. Remove onions & peel off each layer until you reach center. Set aside onion layers & centers.

2. Put beef into a bowl w/rice, salt, pepper, & cuminseed and mix well. Take 1 heaping ts beef mixture & half of 1 prune. Stuff 1 cooked onion layer & roll it up. Do this w/all stuffing & onion layers.

3. Oil a skillet & lay stuffed onions & centers in it, cover, and cook over very low heat for 2 hours. The onions will become quite dark but not, of course, burned. This is top-of-the-stove cooking.

Another method is to put stuffed onions into a baking dish, cover tightly, & bake in preheated, 250f. oven for 2 hrs. Serve warm. Serves 6 w/other dishes.

NOTE: It is also possible to accelerate cooking time. Add 1/2 c water to skillet & cook, covered, over moderate heat for 1 hour. All liquid will evaporate & onions will be browned.
