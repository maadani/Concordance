Ingredients:

1/2 c Rice, uncooked 
1 md Onion, Diced 
1 Green Pepper, Diced 
2 Eggs 
1 lg Head Cabbage 
2 qt Tomato Juice 
Instructions:
PREPARE THE CABBAGE LEAVES: 
The Old timers would freeze the head solid, then peel the leaves from the head as they thawed. The best way I've found is to 1)cut the core out with a knife, then put the hole-where-the-core- was, side down in a steamer over boiling water. Let it sit for about 10 minutes and remove. Several layers of the outer leaves should be soft enough to remove from the head. When you've removed as many as you can, return the head to the steamer to soften more leaves. Take a sharp knife and remove as much of the central vein as you can. 

FILLING: Mix all the other ingredients together in a bowl. work it with your hands until the eggs and other ingredients except the tomato juice are thoroughly mixed into the meat. Now, take a glob of mixture and set it in the hollow of a deveined leaf,with the end that was near the core towards you. Fold the end nearest you about / way over the mix. Fold the left side over the mix and then the right side. Roll about / turn away from you so that the "seam" is on the bottom. Place in the pan seam side don and continue with the other leaves.* When you've made the last cabbage roll,pour in the tomato juice to cover. Bring to a boil then simmer for AT LEAST an hour. Serve in a bowl with the juice, although these, like spaghetti are better the 2nd day. 

*This is an ideal cabbage roll. 3/4 of them won't go together this perfectly, so be ready to make adjustments when making the rolls. 

VARIATIONS: 
Garlic is great, paprika and chili powder will work in the stuffing, V-8 instead of tomato juice is pleasantly different.
