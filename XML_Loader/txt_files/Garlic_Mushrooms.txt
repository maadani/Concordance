Ingredients: 
two dozen large mushrooms, stems carefully removed 
50-100 g butter 
25-50 g crushed garlic (3-6 garlic cloves) 

Instructions:
Proceed as follows:
Fry the mushrooms in a small quantity of butter at high heat. It is important the the mushrooms do not release water, which will happen if the heat is too low. The mushrooms are ready when they have acquired a golden brown hue. 
Mix remaining butter with the crushed garlic. 
Place the mushrooms, one by one and upside down on snail porcelain ramequins, and add a small spoonful of the garlic butter on top of each mushroom. 
Place the snail ramequins in a preheated oven at 200-225 oC and fry for 5-10 minutes. 
Serve together with white bread or toast to facilitate sponging up the melted garlic butter.

Notes:
A specialty of the restaurant Le Gentilhomme in The Hague is mushrooms prepared in the same way as snails. Our children love these mushrooms as much as we do, and of course we started to look for how to prepare them. A piece of advice: Be generous with the garlic!
