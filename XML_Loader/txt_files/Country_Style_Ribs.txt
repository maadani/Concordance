Ingredients 
pork, beef or country style ribs (approx. 1/2 lb (.2 kg). per person) 
Equal parts of: 
teriyaki sauce 
pineapple juice 
white wine 
1 small can (depending on how many you are making) pineapple chunks 
Season with: 
1 or more cloves finely diced fresh garlic (or 1/4 tsp (1 ml) ground if you prefer) 
1 slice fresh ginger, minced (1/16" thick or so) (or 1/4 tsp (1 ml) ground if you prefer) 
sliced spring onions - optional 
2 tbsp (30 ml) sesame seeds - optional 
cooked noodles or rice 

Instructions:
Preparation 
Trim excess fat from ribs if necessary 
Mix all liquid ingredients (including pineapple chunks) and all seasonings. 
Marinate ribs for at least 3 hours, all day is better, 24 hours is even better - be sure to rotate ribs periodically or make sure they are all covered. 
Take left-over marinade, with pineapple, and bring to a boil in pot for 10 minutes to make it suitable to use over noodles or rice. 
You can either start these ribs out in the oven at 350 degrees (175 C.) for about 15 minutes then finish on grill, or place on grill at med-low temperature until fully cooked 
You may thicken the marinade with some arrowroot or cornstarch and serve this (with the pineapple chunks) over egg noodles or rice. 
If marinade gets too salty when boiling you may add more pineapple juice and wine and teriyaki if necessary. 
When pouring in wine be sure and remove from stove first. 
Comments 
The pineapple juice is a natural tenderizer so the longer you marinate these the more tender they will be. This marinade is also good for steaks and chicken wings. The wings I marinate for two days to really pack the flavor in.
