Ingredients: 
1 litre 96 % alcohol 
1 kilogramme black currants 
Instructions:
Proceed as follows:
In a closed large glass jar place the 96 % alcohol at the bottom. 
Place 0.5-1 kilograms of black currants in a gauze bag and suspend this bag over the alcohol. It is important that the black currants are NOT in any way submerged in the alcohol. 
Leave the jar closed in a warm place for at least two months. After that time most of the aroma will have evaporated from the black currants and dissolved in the alcohol, however the pigment still remain in the currants.

Notes:
"Absolut Kurant" is a very popular Swedish vodka, colourless but with a strong taste of black currant. You can prepare a similar (but stronger) beverage yourself, although it takes time. (Normal Swedish "svartvinb채rsbr채nnvin" has a deep dark violet colour and is prepared by extraction of black currant berries.)
