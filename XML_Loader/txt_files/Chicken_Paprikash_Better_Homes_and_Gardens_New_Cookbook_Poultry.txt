2 to 2 1/2 pounds meaty chicken pieces (breasts, thighs, and drumsticks) 
1 tablespoon cooking oil 
1 chopped onion 
3 to 4 teaspoons paprika 
3/4 cup chicken broth 
1/4 cup dry white wine 
1 8-oz carton dairy sour cream 
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 
2 cups hot cooked noodles or rice

Skin chicken, if desired. Rinse and pat dry. In a 12-inch skillet cook chicken in hot oil about 15 minutes or till lightly browned, turning to brown evenly. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Remove chicken, set aside.
Add onion and paprika to skillet; cook till onion is tender. Add chicken, turning pieces to coat with paprika mixture. Add broth and wine. Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Cover; simmer 40 minutes or till chicken is tender and no longer pink.
Transfer chicken to a platter; keep warm. For sauce, skim fat from pan juices. Measure 1 1/2 cups juices, adding water, if necessary. In a bowl stir together sour cream and flour, gradually stir in juices mixture. Pour into skillet. Cook and stir till thickened and bubbly; cook and stir for 1 minute more. Spoon some sauce over chicken; pass remainder. Serve with hot cooked noodles or rice.
