Notes:
Cinnabon gives lemonade a twist by adding strawberry syrup. It's a simple clone when you snag some Hershey's strawberry syrup (near the chocolate syrup in your supermarket), and a few juicy lemons. But if it's a bit of a caffeine buzz you're looking for -- enhanced by a killer chocolate rush -- it's the Mochalatta Chill you'll want to whip up. Brew some double-strength coffee (see Tidbits) and let it cool off, then get out the half & half and chocolate syrup. Man, these sippers are just too dang easy!
