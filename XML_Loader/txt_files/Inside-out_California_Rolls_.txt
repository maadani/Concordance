Ingredients: 
Clingfilm 
3 half-size sheets seaweed paper

Japanese horseradish 
Thinly sliced cucumber 
Flesh of 1 avocado

Toasted sesame seeds and roe (optional), to garnish 
Instructions:
As its name suggests, California Roll is hardly a classical sushi recipe. It is, however, extremely popular across the United States and elsewhere. It is a superb blend of textures - cooked crab, avocado and cucumber. 

Although it is quite possible to make a small roll with sparing amounts of these fillings, inside-out rolls allow for generous servings. A vegetarian version of the California Roll can be made using a combination of cucumber, cooked dried gourd, thinly sliced parboiled carrot, mangetouts and cream cheese! 

To prepare the avocado, halve it, cutting around the stone. Remove the stone and using a large spoon scoop out the flesh from each half in one piece. Slice into strips. 

1. Cover the sushi mat with Clingfilm. Lay the seaweed paper on top and cover with a thin layer of sushi rice. Dip your fingers in a bowl of rice vinegar-water, then lightly press the rice with your fingers to secure it to the seaweed. 
 
2. Turn the seaweed paper and rice over on the covered mat. Smear the seaweed paper with a little Japanese horseradish. 
 
3. Top with cucumber, avocado and crab meat. 
 
4. Carefully start to roll the mat, using your fingers and palms to keep the mat even and the ingredients in place. 
 
5. Compress and shape the roll. 
 
6. Unroll the mat and remove the Clingfilm, then sprinkle with sesame seeds and roe before cutting into six pieces. Repeat to make 2 more rolls.
