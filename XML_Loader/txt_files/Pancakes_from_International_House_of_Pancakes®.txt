Notes:
Even though the early press runs of Top Secret Recipes excluded buttermilk in this recipe -- a very important ingredient if you really want pourable batter -- many figured out the missing ingredient on their own and the error was quickly corrected in later copies. Now we just like to call those copies of the book the "Collector's Editions." For any of you who were lucky enough to get one of the "Collector's Editions" we'd liked to say "Congratulations!" Now here's the recipe, in its entirety, to make pancakes just like those served every day at IHOP.
