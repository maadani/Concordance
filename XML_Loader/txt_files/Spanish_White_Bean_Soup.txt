1 lb White beans, dried 
16 c Water, divided 
2 1/2 lb Ham hocks, 4 hocks 
1 1/4 c Leeks, diced 
2 c Onions, chopped 
1 ts Garlic, chopped 
1/2 ts Thyme, dried 
1 ts Olive oil 
1 1/2 c Carrots, chopped 
1 1/2 c Turnips, cubed

Instructions:
1. Inspect the beans for imperfections or stones and rinse them under cold water. Place in a soup pot with 4 cups water. Bring to a boil and cook 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool 30 minutes. 2. Drain the beans and return them to the soup pot with the remaining 12 cups water. Add the ham hocks, cover, and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer. 3. Meanwhile, saute the leeks, onions, garlic and thyme in the olive oil over medium heat until wilted, about 5 minutes. Add to the soup pot. 4. Cook, covered, 1-1/2 hours. Add the carrots and turnips and cook 30 minutes. 5. Remove the hocks and cool. When cool enough to handle, remove the meat from the bones, discarding the fat. Add the meat to the pot. 6. Add the coriander and serve. Yield: 8 to 10 servings.
