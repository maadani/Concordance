Comments 
In my family, we served this over big thick slices of fresh homemade bread oven toasted with sweet butter. Now, with diets and nutrition concerns, I serve it over steamed rice. But, every now and then, I just HAVE to have that fresh bread and butter! Note: You can substitute Albacore tuna or other flakey fish if you have leftovers too! Use fish stock or chicken stock for the 1 cup of juice. And, if you use frozen peas, use fish stock or chicken stock to make up the 1 cup of liquid for the missing canned pea liquid.
