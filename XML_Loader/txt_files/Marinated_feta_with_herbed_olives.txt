Ingredients:
1/2 tsp ( 2 mL) freshly cracked black pepper 
1 tbsp ( 15 mL) chopped fresh rosemary leaves 
1 roasted red pepper, store-bought or home-made, finely chopped 
1/2 cup ( 125 mL) coarsely chopped pitted green or black olives or a mix 
1 lemon 
8 oz ( 250-g) block feta cheese 
1/4 cup ( 50 mL) olive oil 

Instructions:
1. Finely grate lemon peel and squeeze out 2 tablespoons (30 mL) juice. If feta is salty, rinse under cold running water. Slice feta in half so you have 2 slices, each about 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick. Place in a single layer in a glass bowl or container just a little larger than feta. 

2. In a bowl, whisk oil with lemon juice. Pour mixture over feta. Sprinkle with lemon peel, pepper, rosemary, roasted pepper and olives. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least overnight but preferably up to 2 days. Occasionally baste lemon mixture overtop. Remove from refrigerator 1 hour before serving. 

3. To serve, stack feta on a plate, then pour lemon mixture overtop. Great with baguette slices or crackers for spreading cheese.

Notes:
Here's a new twist on the old cheese tray, inspired by a recipe in Georgeanne Brennan's delightful cookbook, Olives, Anchovies and Capers (Raincoast).
