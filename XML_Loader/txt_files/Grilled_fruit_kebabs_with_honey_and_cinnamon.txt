Ingredients:
4 (12-inch/30-cm) skewers 
2 tbsp ( 30 mL) liquid honey 
2 tbsp ( 30 mL) balsamic vinegar 
2 tsp ( 10 mL) grated lime peel 
1/4 tsp ( 1 mL) cinnamon, nutmeg or hot red chili flakes 
4 cups ( 1 L) bite-size pieces mixed fresh fruit, such as pineapple, mangoes, bananas, strawberries, peaches and grapes 
3 large basil leaves (optional) 

Instructions:
1. If using bamboo skewers, soak in water for at least 15 minutes. Grease grill, then preheat barbecue to high. In a large bowl, stir honey with vinegar, peel and cinnamon. 

2. Cut pineapple, mangoes and bananas into bite-size chunks. If strawberries are large, slice in half. Cut peaches into wedges and leave grapes whole. Add to honey mixture and gently stir to combine. Let fruit marinate for 5 to 10 minutes. Then alternately thread fruit onto skewers. 

3. Grill kebabs, turning at least once, until fruit is tender, from 4 to 5 minutes per side. Meanwhile, stack basil leaves, if using, on top of one another. Thinly slice into strips. Remove kebabs to a serving platter. Sprinkle with basil. Great with vanilla ice cream or frozen yogurt.

Notes:
Warm and glazed with honey, these kebabs are light yet taste luxurious. They’re also a cinch to prepare--just make sure to select ripe but firm good-quality fruit as it’s the focal point of the dessert. Sprinkling some shredded basil overtop gives them a gourmet edge.
