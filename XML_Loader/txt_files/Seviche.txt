Ingredients: 
400-500 g fish filets, e.g. plaice or sole 
200 ml fresh lemon juice 
1-2 finely chopped red jalapeño peppers 
1-2 crushed garlic cloves 
5-10 g crushed coriander seeds 
salt and black pepper as required 
200 g peeled, deseeded and coarsely chopped tomatoes 
100 g finely chopped leek 
200 g peeled and diced cucumber 

Instructions:
Proceed as follows:
Cut the fish filets into 1.5 - 2 cm pieces. Place them in bowl that is not too large for the refrigerator. Add the jalapeño peppers, garlic and coriander and pour the lemon juice on top of the mixture. The juice should cover the fish pieces, if not they will have to be compressed. 
If so desired also the vegetables can be added to the fish-lemon-spice mixture. This is specially recommended if you intend to serve the dish as the main course during a lunch on a hot summer day.

Leave the bowl for at least 3, if possible 4 - 6 hours in the refrigerator. The fish flesh should be white and opaque and not translucent any more when the "cooking" is complete. 
Serve together with a cold beer (Corona?) and toasted bread or baguette.

Notes:
During "normal" cooking fish flesh, i.e. the protein, is transferred into a new, coagulated form by heating. A similar result can be achieved by the use of an acid. Seviche is fish that has been cooked by treatment with lemon or lime juice and bears no similarity to raw fish. It is important that the fish is very fresh and skinless.
