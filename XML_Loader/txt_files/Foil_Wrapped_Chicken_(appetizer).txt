  Cut out squares of aluminum foil. Wrap each piece of chicken into a 
piece of foil dropping in a litte extra sauce mixture in with the 
chicken pieces Make sure chicken is securly wrapped with no leaks. Drop 
the foil parcels in hot fat and fry for about 2 minutes turning once if 
possible but not that important. Drain. The correct way to serve the 
chicken is in its wrapper, since the wrapping holds in the flavour and 
juices.
