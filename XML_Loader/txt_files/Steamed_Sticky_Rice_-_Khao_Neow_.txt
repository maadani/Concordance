Ingredients:
4 c Sticky Rice 
Instructions:
Place the rice in a saucepan or bowl and add enough water to cover. Rub the rice between your hands several times and drain off the milky water. Add clean water and repeat the process until the water runs clear. 
Soak the rice overnight in enough water to cover or, to save time, the rice can be soaked in hot water for 3 hours before steaming, rather than overnight. 
Drain the rice and place in a cloth-lined steamer or in a steaming basket. Place the basket over a pot of boiling water, making sure that the basket does not touch the water. Cover the steamer and steam for approximately 30 minutes.
