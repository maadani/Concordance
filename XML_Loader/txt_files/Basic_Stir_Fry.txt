Makes 3 to 4 servings.

**  Stir Fry Ingredients  **

1/2 pound (250 g) lean beef, pork, chicken, or fish, with bones removed
4-6 cups of fresh vegetables, diced
3   tablespoons peanut oil
1-3 tablespoons of water

 **  Marinade Ingredients  **

1   tablespoon soya sauce
1   tablespoon sherry or saki (rice wine)
1   teaspoon corn starch
1   teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon ground fresh ginger (keeps well in the freezing compartment)


Instructions:
1) Mix the Marinade ingredients in a medium size bowl.

2) Cut the meat into thin strips, 1" long. Then soak the strips in the 
marinade for at least 15 minutes.

3) Set the temperature of an electric non-stick wok to 360 F (185 C). Put 
1 tablespoon of oil in the wok, and wait for the wok to heat up. When the 
wok is hot, the red power indicator light will go off.

4) Put the marinated meat in the wok and stir constantly, for a few 
minutes, with a couple of wooden spatulas or spoons. Remove the meat once 
it is brown on the outside, but is still a little pink on the inside.

5) Wipe the wok clean with some paper towels. Be careful not to burn your 
hands on the hot wok surface!

6) Add 2 tablespoons of oil, and wait for the wok to heat up again.

7) Add the vegetables and stir constantly until they are soft, about 5 
minutes.

8) Add some water, amount depending on how much water has collected in the 
wok from the vegetables. Then cover the wok and let the vegetables steam 
for 3 minutes.

9) Add the browned meat and stir constantly until everything is hot, a 
couple of minutes. Serve immediately with brown rice.
