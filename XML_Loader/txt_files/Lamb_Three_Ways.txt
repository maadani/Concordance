3 1/2 pound leg of lamb 
1 onion, chopped 
1 1/2 cups chicken stock (approx.) 
2 tablespoons cornstarch 
1/4 teaspoon salt 
1/4 teaspoon pepper 
Mediterranean:   
1 cup red wine 
1 onion, chopped 
1 teaspoon dried mint 
1 teaspoon dried tarragon 
1 teaspoon dried thyme 
1/4 teaspoon salt 
Caribbean:   
2 tablespoons vegetable oil 
1 tablespoon grated gingerroot 
1 teaspoon ground cumin 
3/4 teaspoon salt 
1/2 teaspoon pepper 
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander 
1/2 teaspoon turmeric 
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 
Italian:   
10 cloves garlic 
2 tablespoons olive oil 
1/2 teaspoon salt 
1/2 teaspoon pepper 
1/2 cup grated Romano cheese 

Instructions:
1. Mediterranean: In dish, mix wine, onion, mint, tarragon, and thyme. Add lamb; turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 8 to 24 hours. Brush off onion; sprinkle with salt. Strain marinade into saucepan; boil for 5 minutes.

2. Caribbean: In small bowl, stir together oil, ginger, cumin, salt, pepper, coriander, turmeric, and cayenne pepper; brush evenly over lamb.

3. Italian: Make 10 tiny slits all over lamb; insert garlic clove completely into each slit. Brush lamb with oil; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Press cheese all over lamb to adhere.

4. Place lamb on greased rack in roasting pan; insert meat thermometer in thickest part. Roast in 350 degree oven for about 1 hour and 45 minutes or until 160 degrees for medium-rare. Transfer to platter; tent with foil and let stand for 15 minutes while making gravy. Skim fat from pan.

5. Add onion to pan; cook for 5 minutes. (For Mediterranean, add enough stock to boiled marinade to make 1 1/2 cups.) Pour in stock; bring to boil, scraping up brown bits. Mix cornstarch with 2 tablespoons water; stir into pan. Add salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until thickened. Strain if desired.

6. Place lamb on carving board with meatier portion facing up. Grip shank end firmly with towel. Cut down to bone into 1/4 inch thick slices. With knife parallel to bone, cut slices off along bone. Turn lamb so remaining meaty portion faces up. Carve as first side.
