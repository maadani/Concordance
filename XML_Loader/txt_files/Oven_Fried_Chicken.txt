Ingredients:
5 ounces hard pretzels, broken into small chunks 
1 tablespoon olive or peanut oil 
2 large eggs 
1 1/2 teaspoons Dijon mustard 
1 1/2 teaspoons dried thyme 
1 1/2 teaspoons dried marjoram 
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder 
1/4 teaspoon salt 
  Pepper, to taste 
Pinch cayenne (optional) 
3 1/2 pound chicken, cut into 8 pieces (or chicken legs) 

Instructions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Spray a roasting rack with nonstick spray & place it in a foil-lined roasting pan.

Pulse the pretzels in a food processor or blender until coarsely crumbed (some small pea-size crumbs should remain), with the motor running, drizzle in the oil and pulse just to mix well. Transfer to a wide, shallow bowl or pie plate.

Whisk together the eggs, mustard, thyme, marjoram, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and cayenne in another bowl or pie plate.

Working one at a time, dip the chicken pieces with one hand into the egg mix to coat, then place in the crumb mixture. Use your other hand to press the crumbs into the chicken on all sides, turning to coat well. Shake off the excess crumbs and place the chicken on the prepared rack. Bake until the chicken is cooked through and juices run clear when pierced with a fork, about 45 minutes.
