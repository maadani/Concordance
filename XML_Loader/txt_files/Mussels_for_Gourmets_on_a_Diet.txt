Ingredients: 
2 kgs fresh Zeeland mussels, the larger the better (and more expensive) 
100-200 g peeled and thinly sliced carrots 
100 g thinly sliced celery 
a small leek, thinly sliced 
6-10 garlic cloves, finely chopped (this is one secret ingredient!) 
a small onion, finely chopped 
100-200 ml dry white wine 
0.5 g saffron (this is the other secret ingredient) 

Instructions:
Proceed as follows:
Clean the mussels and discard those that appear to be dead, i.e. will not close their shells when a friendly pressure has been applied a few times. Parboil the veggie mix in the microwave oven at full power (700 W), 1.5 minutes for every 100 grammes of vegetables. 
Transfer the vegetables to a 6 liter casserole, add the wine, the saffron and the mussels and bring to a boil. 
Stir now and then (about every 10 seconds), using a wooden fork if available, until all the mussels have opened (this should only take a few minutes). The dish is now ready to be served. 
The mussels can best be served together with toast, aïoli and, if available, zeekraal. The easiest way to eat the mussels is to use a pair of empty mussel shells as tweezers to pick the mussel meat out of the shells.

Notes:
The availability of mussels in Umeå was very limited. Small and expensive plastic bags with a contents of dubious freshness appeared once a week on the fish dish at one of the major department stores in the town (there were two of them), otherwise all mussels were of the canned variety.
You can imagine how thrilled and enthused we became when we first became aware of the ready availability of mussels in the Netherlands. Of course we started to experiment, and finally arrived at the following recipe.
