Ingredients:
1/4 cup ( 50 mL) vegetable oil 
2 large onions, finely chopped 
4 garlic cloves 
1 tbsp ( 15 mL) chili powder 
1 tbsp ( 15 mL) ground cumin 
1/2 tsp ( 2 mL) cayenne pepper 
1 to 2 lemons 
1 cup ( 250 mL) ketchup 
1/4 cup ( 50 mL) brown sugar 
2 tbsp ( 30 mL) Worcestershire sauce 
8 beef ribs, each about 7 inches (18 cm) long, about 5 lbs (2.5 kg) 


Instructions:
1. To make sauce, heat oil in a large saucepan set over medium heat. Add onions, garlic, chili powder and spices. Cook, stirring often, until onion has softened, about 5 minutes. Squeeze enough juice from lemons to measure 1/4 cup. Stir into onions along with ketchup, brown sugar and Worcester shire. Bring to a boil, stirring often. Reduce heat to low and simmer, uncovered, until thickened, about 15 to 20 minutes. Stir often, especially near end of cooking time. Use right away or cover and refrigerate for up to 1 week. 

2. When ready to barbecue ribs, oil grill and preheat barbecue. Place ribs bone-side down on barbecue and grill, turning at least once, for 30 minutes. Spoon about a third of barbecue sauce into a serving dish to be used as a dipping sauce for ribs and set aside. While ribs are on grill, liberally brush them with remaining sauce. Continue barbecuing, turning and brushing often with sauce, until richly glazed and browned, about 15 to 30 more minutes depending on thickness of meat. As soon as ribs are done as you like, move to a cooler part of grill or remove. Cover to keep warm. Serve piping hot with extra sauce, corn on the cob and a selection of salads.

Notes:
These ribs are decadent, slathered with a lemon-jolted homemade barbecue sauce. Before digging in, tie on a bib and have plenty of serviettes handy. Most supermarkets carry beef ribs, but if yours doesn't, ask your local butcher to save them for you. They're generally cheaper than pork ribs.
