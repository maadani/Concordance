Ingredients:
1 cup         dates (180g) -- pitted and chopped
1 tsp         bicarbonate of soda
1 cup         boiling water
2 TBSP        butter
1 cup         soft brown sugar   (150 g)
2             eggs.
1 1/2  cups   self-raising flour   (180 g) --    sifted

Toffee Sauce:
1 cup         soft brown sugar   (150 g)
3/4 cup         light whipping cream.
1/2 tsp         vanilla
2 TBSP        butter

Instructions:
Mix dates and baking soda in a heat-proof bowl. Pour boiling water on top and leave to stand. Cream butter and sugar until pale, then add eggs one at a time, heating well after each addition. Gently fold in sifted flour, stir in the date mixture, and pour into a lightly buttered 18cm or 7"
square or round cake tin. Bake in a preheated oven (180 C) for 30-40 minutes, until an inserted skewer comes clean. 
Combine sugar, cream, vanilla essence and butter in a saucepan, bring to the boil, stirring, and simmer for five minutes. Set aside until ready to serve, then quickly reheat when needed. Cut pudding into squares and place each square in the centre of a warm dinner plate.  Pour hot toffee sauce over each square and serve with fresh cream.
