Ingredients: 
600 grams of thick flank, cut in thin slices 
4 onions, cut into thin slices 
8-10 potatoes, peeled and cut in rather thick slices 
butter 
bay leaf 
thyme 
salt and white pepper 
5 dl (2 cups) water or bouillon, mixed with beer or just beer 

Instructions:
Proceed as follows:
Brown the onion slices and remove them from the frying-pan. 
In the same pan brown the meat slices briefly on both sides. Season with salt and white pepper. 
Add water, beer and/or bouillon, bay-leaf and thyme, cover and let the meat cook for 10 minutes in the frying-pan. 
In a casserole put layers of meat, sliced potato and onion, potatoes forming the bottom and uppermost layer. 
Cover with liquid and let the stew simmer in the oven or on the stove for 45 - 60 minutes (cooking time is not critical). Serve sizzling hot. 

You can also prepare the stew in a pressure cooker instead of a casserole. This will shorten the cooking time to 15 minutes and, at the same time, less liqiud can be used, since it is not essential that the stew be completely covered.
