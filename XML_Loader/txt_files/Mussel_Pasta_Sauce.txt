Ingredients:
Ingredients: 
100 - 200 grams of cooked and deshelled mussels (see the basic recipe) 
250 ml (1 cup) of saffron-spiced mussel bouillon (see the basic recipe) 
125 ml (1/2 cup) whipping cream 
1 egg yolk 
fresh pasta as desired, e.g. linguine or a similar band pasta that can well carry the the chopped mussels 
Instructions:
Proceed as follows:
Chop half of the mussels coarsely. 
In a large pan (there should be space enough also for the pasta), mix the whipping cream and the bouillon; heat until a slow boil, add the chopped mussels and let the mixture simmer for a few minutes. 
Remove the sauce from the heat, add the egg yolk while stirring. 
Continue the heating at a very low heat (the sauce must never boil!) until the whole mussels have absorbed enough saffron taste. 
Meanwhile, cook the fresh pasta. The cooking time will depend on the type of pasta you have chosen. 
Drain the pasta, then add it to the mussel sauce, stir, add the remaining unchopped mussels, and continue stirring at very low heat for a minute or two. Serve immediately. 
The selection of pasta is important. Do not use a dry type pasta; the flavor of the mussel sauce is too delicate. Also, stay away from very thin fresh pasta since that requires a creamy sauce without any solid particles.

Notes:
Fresh pasta can be prepared in a matter of minutes, a rather important aspect when it comes to aphrodisiac cooking. And what can be a better way of serving the pasta than together with a mussel sauce with a strong saffron taste?.
