Notes:
"Västerbotten" is probably not only the best known but also the best of all Swedish cheeses, The production is small and it is difficult to find this cheese outside Sweden. A well-aged Stilton cheese migh be a possible substitute in the present recipe, which we originally got from Maiken Karlsson. (When we first heard about cheese icecream, we were as hesitant as you probably are, but give it a try!)
