In western countries they feed this stuff to animals! No kidding. But I am telling you, this is delicious food. My favorite. You have to try this one.

Note: You may use chicken livers and or hearts, do not cook livers as long to prevent drying them out. Hearts tend to be chewy and crunchy. Arabs and Chinese know how to not waste any part of an animal, and make taste good.
