Ingredients:
16 oz Rice noodles 
1/2 c Vegetable oil 
5 Garlic cloves (or more) - finely chopped 
1 lb Medium shrimp - shelled and deveined 
2 Firm-style bean curd squares - cut into 1/2 inch cubes 
1/4 c Pickled turnips - (coarsely chopped) 
1/2 c White vinegar 
3/16 c Fish sauce 
1 tb Paprika 
1/4 c Sugar 
2 Eggs; beaten 
1/4 lb Mung bean sprouts 
3 Scallions - cut into 1/2 inch pieces 
1/2 c Ground unsalted peanuts 
1 Fresh red chili pepper - seeded & coarsely chopped 
1 Lemon; cut into wedges 
Coriander leaves for garnish 
1/4 c Crushed red pepper (opt.) 

Instructions:
In a large bowl, soak the rice noodles in 10 to 12 cups of cold water for 2 hours. Drain and cover with a damp towel to retain moisture. 
In a wok or large frying pan, heat the oil and stir-fry the garlic until it is light brown. Add the shrimp, bean curd and pickled turnips; stir in the vinegar, fish sauce, paprika and sugar. When thoroughly mixed, fold in the noodles. When the noodles are completely coated, spread them out to the sides of the wok or frying pan, leaving a space in the middle. Add the beaten eggs. As the eggs cook, fold the noodles over them and stir to combine all of the ingredients evenly. Stir in half of the bean sprouts, then add the scallions, ground peanuts and chopped chili pepper. Toss several times to mix well. 
Serve on a large platter with lemon wedges. Top with the remaining bean sprouts and garnish with coriander leaves. Serve the crushed red pepper on the side, for those who like it extra-spicy.
