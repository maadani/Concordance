Ingredients: 
200 g gravlax 
200 g avocado meat (scoope out the meat of a medium-sized ripe avocado) 
2 tbsp dry sherry 
2 tbsp fresh lemon juice 
salt and pepper as desired 
Instructions:
Proceed as follows:
Set aside 50-75 grams of the gravlax. Puree the remainder in the food processor. 
Add the avocado meat and continue pureeing. 
Add the sherry, the lemon juice and pepper and salt as desired and continue the pureeing until you have a smooth mousse. 
Spread the mousse on crackers or small pieces of toast. 
Cut the remaining gravlax into thin strips and use these to adorn the mousse. 
We have tried several ways of spicing the mousse (e.g., cognac and port wine) but dry sherry is by far the best way. What remains to be tested is what a few dashes of TabascoÂ® would do to the dish. If you try that before we do, please let us know about the result.

Notes:
When you end up with leftovers of gravlax, this mousse is a great way of using them. On a hot summer evening serve it refrigerated, but on a cold winter day it can even be served at room temperature.
