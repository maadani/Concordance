Ingredients: 
250 g fillets of a fish with firm, white meat, cut into 6 pieces 
250 g fresh mushrooms 
25-50 g crushed garlic cloves 
3-5 tbsp dry white wine or vermouth 
extra virgin olive oil for frying 
spices: salt, estragon, black pepper as desired 

Instructions:
Proceed as follows:
Divide the mushrooms into 2 - 4 pieces. 
Heat the oil to about 160 oC in a frying pan (at this temperature butter starts to acquire a nut brown colour and a piece of white bread dropped into the oil turns golden brown within 15 - 30 seconds). 
Fry the mushroom pieces together with the crushed garlic until the mushrooms begin to turn brownish (it takes at least 3 - 4 minutes, if necessary, lower the temperature after a few minutes). 
Remove the mushrooms from the frying pan but leave any garlic residues in the pan. 
Add the fish pieces, kind of stir-fry them for 15 - 30 seconds, then add the wine and bring to a boil for another 15 - 30 seconds. 
Return the mushroom pieces to the frying pan and let the mixture simmer for one minute.

Notes:
You can combine garlic and fish! One extreme is to serve fish filled with garlic (bake plenty of garlic cloves in the oven at 250 oC for 10 minutes, then stuff, e.g. a cod, laithe or similar fish with the baked cloves and bake the stuffed fish at 200 oC for another 25-50 minutes, depending on size). But usually it suffices to let the garlic add a magic touch.
