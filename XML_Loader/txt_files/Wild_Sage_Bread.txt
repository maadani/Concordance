Ingredients:
1 package dry yeast 
1 cup cottage cheese 
1 egg 
1 tablespoon melted shortening 
1 tablespoon sugar 
2 teaspoons crushed dried sage 
1/2 teaspoon salt 
1/4 teaspoon baking soda 
2 1/2 cups flour


Instructions:
Combine sugar, sage, salt, baking soda and flour. Dissolve yeast in 1/4 cup warm water. Beat egg and cottage cheese together until smooth. Add melted shortening and yeast.

Add flour mixture slowly to egg mixture, beating well after each addition until a stiff dough is formed.

Cover dough with cloth and put in warm place until double in bulk (about 1 hour). Punch dough down, knead for one minute and place in well-greased pan. Cover and let rise for 40 minutes.

Bake in a 350-degree oven for 50 minutes. Brush top with melted shortening and sprinkle with crushed, roasted pine nuts or coarse salt.
