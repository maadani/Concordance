1 1/4 cups  Red wine vinegar
5 cups  Sugar

Combine the chiles and pepper with the vinegar in a food processor. Process 3 minutes until pureed.
  
Put the puree and sugar in a saucepan.  Bring to a boil over medium high heat, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat, skim the foam from the top,   discard, and add the pectin. Return to the heat and bring again to a hard boil for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat and stir constantly for 5 minutes.
  
As it cools the jelly will begin to thicken.  Pour it into clean, sterilized 8-ounce jars, leaving a 1/4
