Ingredients: 

  -grammie's kitchen 
2 lb Stewing beef 
2 lg Onions; chopped fine 
1 tb Brown sugar 
2 tb Corn oil 
2 ts Pepper 
1 ts Salt; (optional) 
1/2 lb Carrots; chopped 
  -water or stock to cover 


Instructions:
Cut the meat into 1/2 in. cubes. Brown in hot oil both sides. Then add the onions and sugar. Cook until the onions are brown and tender. Then barely cover the meat with water or stock; add the spices. Add carrots and simmer until tender (about 2 hours).
For added flavor; I have added 1/3 cup of red wine.

THE CRUST: Boil 5 or 6 large potatoes until tender, then strain and return to the pan. Mash over a gentle heat with a generous tbsp. of parave margarine or chicken fat. Add salt and pepper to taste. Nondairy, kosher for Passover, creamer can be added for creaminess. Remove from heat and add 2 well-beaten eggs and a tea. of chopped parsley. Use this mixture to line the bottom and sides of a deep casserole, previously well-greased.

Pour in the hot stew and smooth the remaining potato mixture on the top. Brush with a little egg. Put in quick oven, 400 degrees for 15-20 minutes or until a rich brown. Serves 6 generously.
