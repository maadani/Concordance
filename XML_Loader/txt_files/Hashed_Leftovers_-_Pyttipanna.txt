Notes:
Pyttipanna" can be made in a variety of ways. Essentially, it is a traditional Swedish way of using meat left-overs. The three basic ingredients are finely diced potatoes, finely chopped onion, and diced meat left-overs (e.g. sausages, pork chops, tenderloin, almost anything will do; the better the meat quality, the better the "pyttipanna").
