Ingredients:
6 small canned tomatoes, with juice  
1 whole fresh hot chile  
4 medium onions , whole  
1/4 cup green bell pepper  
6 tbsp vegetable oil  
1 lb stewing beef , cut in cubes  
1 cup water [or beef broth]  
1/4 tsp sugar  
1/4 tsp salt  
2 tsp cayenne [more or less to taste]  
1 1/2 tsp minced fresh ginger  
1 lb fresh spinach 

Instructions:
1. Reserve 1/2 cup of juice from the canned tomatoes, and discard the rest of the juice. Combine the chile, tomatoes, onions, and green bell pepper in a food processor, and process until the vegetables are minced but not pureed.

2. Heat the oil in a large, cast-iron pot, and saute the vegetables and beef for 5 minutes over high heat.

3. Add the reserved tomato juice, water sugar, salt, cayenne, and ginger. Cover, lower the heat, and simmer for 2 hours. Stir occasionally to keep from burning.

4. Meanwhile, soak the spinach in warm water for 15 minutes. Then rinse thoroughly, separate, rinse again (and even a third time if you want to be extra careful), shred coarsely, and set aside.

5. After 2 hours, add the spinach to the pot and cook over medium heat for 30 minutes, until the water is gone and the spinach is cooked.

6. About half an hour before serving, prepare boiled rice. Serve Shoko with rice. [Also good served with Yam Foofoo.]
