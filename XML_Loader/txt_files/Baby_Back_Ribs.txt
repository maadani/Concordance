Ingredients:
Serves/Makes:4-6

Ingredients 
4 racks pork baby back ribs 
3 large white onions 
1 2-liter bottle Canada Dry Ginger Ale 
1 bottle your favorite BBQ sauce (I use Bullseye's Original).
Instructions:
Place ribs (bone side down) in shallow baking pan(s). 
Add ginger ale until ribs are completely submerged. 
Cut onions in semi-thick (about 1/4 inch) slices. 
Place onions directly on ribs (3-4 slices per rack) 
Cover pan(s) with aluminum foil and bake at 300degrees for 3 hours. 
Let cool to room temperature (still covered). 
Place ribs on medium-high grill. 
Add bbq sauce to taste. 
Note: Only grill ribs bone side down, no need to turn over. 
The ribs will be so tender they will fall apart if you try 
to turn them. 


Serves:
6
Notes:
You may also use 7-Up vice ginger ale. I prefer ginger ale. I also tried this with country style ribs, it turned out ok, but I prefer baby backs. These will be the best homemade baby back ribs you have ever had!
