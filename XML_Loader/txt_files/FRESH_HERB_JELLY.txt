Ingredients:
Yield: 32 Ounces
2 cups  Water
3/4 cup  Freshly squeezed lemon juice
1 pkg Powdered pectin (1 3/4 oz)
4 cups  Sugar
1/4 cup  Fresh chives, finely chopped
1/4 cup  Fresh thyme leaves, finely chopped
1/4 cup  Fresh oregano leaves, finely chopped
1/4 cup  Fresh basil leaves, finely chopped
1/4 cup  Fresh tarragon leaves,  finely chopped

Instructions:
In a large saucepan, stir together the water, lemon juice and powdered pectin.  Scrape the sides of the pan to make sure all the pectin has dissolved.
  
Place the saucepan over high heat and bring to a boil.  Stir constantly to prevent scorching.  Add the sugar and herbs while stirring. Bring the mixture to a full,  rolling boil 4 minutes, then remove from the heat.  Skim the foam off the top of the mixture and pour into clean, sterilized jars. Seal with parrafin, if desired, and allow to set overnight.
  
*** NOTE *** If the herb jelly does not set overnight, remove the parrafin and reheat the mixture over high heat. Bring to a hard rolling boil 2 minutes, repour into the jars, and reseal. Because you are working with herbs and not fruit, sometimes the pectin doesn't  react the first time and needs to be reboiled.
