Ingredients: 

1 lb Poppy seeds 
2 c Honey 
1/2 c Sugar 
2 c Chopped nuts 
1/2 ts Powdered ginger 

Instructions:
Have the poppy seeds ground for you when you buy them. If this is not possible, grind them in a food chopper or pound with a mortar and pestle.
Cook together the honey and sugar until syrupy. Stir in the poppy seeds and cook until the mixture is thick, about 20 minutes. Stir frequently. (Drop a little on a wet surface; if it doesn't run, it is thick enough.) Stir in the nuts and ginger.

Moisten hands; pat out mixture onot wet board to thickness of about 1/2 inch. Let cool 5 minutes, then cut into diamonds or squares with a sharp knife. When knife sticks, dip into hot water. Cool completely and lift from board with a spatula.
