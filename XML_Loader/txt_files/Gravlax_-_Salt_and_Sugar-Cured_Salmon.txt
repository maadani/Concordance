Ingredients: 
2 pieces of centre-cut salmon fillets, little more than 1 pound (500 g) each, if possible of equal size, and with skin left on. 
slightly more than 1/2 cup sugar 
slightly less than !/2 cup coarse salt (somewhat more sugar than salt) 
15 coarsely crushed white peppercorns 
1 very large bunch of dill (very important) - it´s not necessary to chop the dill 
Instructions:
Proceed as follows:
Remove any small bones from the fillets, it´s easily done with the use of a pair of forceps. 
Mix sugar, salt and pepper in a bowl. 
Cover the bottom of a baking dish with dill. 
Rub half of the sugar-salt mixture into the first fillet, on both sides, and lay it skinside down, on top of the dill. Cover with lots of dill. Prepare the other salmon fillet in the same way, and cover with the remaining fillet., skinside up. with the remaining dill on top. 
Cover in plastic wrap, place a cutting board with some heavy weights on top and marinate in the refrigerator for 48 - 72 hours, turning the salmon upside down at least once a day. (Personally, we favour 3 days in the refrigerator!) 
Scrape the marinade off and slice the fillets very thinly. Serve with a mustard sauce

Notes:
Internationally, this might be the best known Swedish dish. Several recipies have been posted on the Net, e.g. this , but, of course, ours is the best! (We are a little bit sceptical when people try to "improve" the gravlax by using, e.g. whisky or gin in the marinade.)
