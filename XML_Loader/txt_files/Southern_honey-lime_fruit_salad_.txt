Ingredients:
2 limes 
1/4 cup ( 50 mL) liquid honey 
1/4 cup ( 50 mL) tequila, rum or bourbon 
1/2 tsp ( 2 mL) dry mustard 
1/4 tsp ( 1 mL) salt 
4 cups ( 1 L) fruit pieces or berries  

Instructions:
1. Squeeze 1/4 cup (50 mL) juice from limes. In a small bowl, whisk juice with honey, tequila, mustard and salt. Place fruit in a large bowl. Pour in dressing and stir until coated. To develop flavours, let sit at room temperature, stirring occasionally, for at least an hour or up to 3 hours. Or cover and refrigerate for up to half a day. 

2. Fruit tip: Sturdy fruit such as pineapple chunks, mango or peach slices and firm strawberries hold very well for hours and are a good choice for the base of this salad. If using soft fruit such as melons, bananas, raspberries or blueberries, add them just before serving.

Notes:
A touch of dry mustard intensifies tequila's wallop of flavour in this dessert. Trudy Patterson, Chatelaine's former Test Kitchen assistant, found this marinade so good she now serves it poured over crushed ice for sipping.
