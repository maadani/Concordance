Instructions:
Add slowly more and more water while kneading the dough. In the end it should
be a creamy substance, pancake-like.

Let it stand for 5 till 30 minutes to soak through.

Heat oil in a deep pan and deep-fat-fry spoonfuls of dough. Alternatively
slice a raw potatoe into thin slices, turn them in the dough and deep-fat-fry.

If you like it hot, sprinkle some chat masala on the brown Pakora pieces.
