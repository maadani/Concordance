Ingredients:
1 egg 
1 tsp ( 5 mL) Worcestershire sauce 
3/4 tsp ( 3 mL) salt 
1/2 tsp ( 2 mL) coarsely ground black pepper 
1 lb ( 500 g) ground beef, preferably medium 
1/2 cup ( 125 mL) minced or finely chopped onion 
1 tbsp ( 15 mL) chopped fresh thyme or 3/4 tsp (3 mL) dried leaf thyme 
2 garlic cloves, minced 
1 red onion 
4 oz ( 120 g) Oka cheese, thinly sliced 
    4 burger or kaiser buns 

Instructions:
1. In a large bowl, whisk egg with Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper. Crumble in beef and then add minced onion, thyme and garlic. Combine, using a fork or your hands, just until blended. Shape into 4 patties, each about 3/4 inches (2 cm) thick. 

2. Oil grill and preheat barbecue to medium-high heat. Place patties on grill, cover and barbecue for 6 to 8 minutes per side for well-done burgers. After placing patties on grill, thickly slice red onion and place on grill around patties. Turn onions every 3 to 4 minutes or until softened and slightly charred. 

3. Top each burger with a slice of cheese for last 2 to 3 minutes of grilling. Warm buns on grill as well. Place each hot burger on a warm bun. Top with grilled onion, sliced tomato and lettuce or other garnishes you like.

Notes:
By the time fall arrives, it's easy to feel ho hum about grilled burgers -- but not if you make these ones from the Buffalo Mountain Lodge in Banff, Alta. They're a clever combination of fresh thyme, grilled red onion and melted Oka cheese.
