Ingredients:
5.5 pound leg of lamb
3 large cloves garlic, cut in thin slivers
0.25 cup olive oil
0.25 cup plus 2 tablespoons lemon juice, divided
2 teaspoons oregano
0.5 teaspoon rosemary, crumbled
0.5 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
8 small or 4 medium-sized artichokes
Instructions:
Preheat oven to 500 degrees F. Trim excess fat from lamb. 
With sharp paring knife, cut small slits in lamb; insert
garlic slivers. Place lamb, rounded side up, in large shallow
roasting pan; set aside. 

In small bowl, combine olive oil, 0.25 cup lemon juice,
oregano, 1 tsp. salt, rosemary and pepper; brush over lamb. 
If using meat thermometer, insert into thickest part of lamb
without touching bone. Place lamb in oven. IMMEDIATELY
reduce temperature to 350 deg. F. 

Roast 1.5 - 2 hours or until thermometer registers 140 degrees
for rare, 160 for medium, or 170 for well done. Baste lamb
with pan juices every 20 minutes. 

Wash artichokes under cold running water; cut off tops 0.5 to
1 inch; trim stems, leaving about 0.5 inch stub; remove small
tough outer leaves at base; snip off prickly leaf tips with
scissors. Leave small artichokes whole. Spread petals
slightly with fingers. Scoop out fuzzy choke at stem end with
small spoon. Cut medium sized artichokes in half lengthwise;
scoop out choke. 

Drop artichokes into large saucepan filled with cold water,
the remaining 2 tablespoons lemon juice and 1 tsp. salt, if
desired. Bring water just to a simmer; cover. Cook small
artichokes 20-25 minutes; medium sized ones for 25-30 minutes
or just until firm tender. To test, insert tines of fork into
stem end - it should be firm but "give" slightly; drain. 

About 30 minutes before lamb is done, arrange artichokes in
roasting pan around lamb. Pour 0.5 cup hot water into
roasting pan. Baste artichoke with pan juices a few times
during final roasting. 

Remove lamb to large serving platter; remove meat thermometer. 
Arrange artichokes around lamb. Cover loosely with foil; let
stand 15 minutes before carving. 

Pour off all drippings from roasting pan into large measuring
cup; let stand so that fat separates from juices at bottom;
remove fat and discard. Pour pan juices back into roasting
pan; add 0.5 cup hot water. Place roasting pan over low heat
and heat to serving temperature, stirring constantly. Pour
into gravy boat.
