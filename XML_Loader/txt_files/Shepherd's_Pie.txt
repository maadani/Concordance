Ingredients:
500g minced lamb 
675g potato(es) 
1 medium onion(s) 
1 stick celery 
1 medium carrot(s) 
175ml lamb stock 
25g butter 
50ml milk 
2 tbsp oil 
2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce 
1 tbsp tomato puree 
salt and ground pepper to taste 

Instructions:
1. Peel the potatoes and cut into even sized chunks. Transfer to a saucepan and cover with cold water. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and boil for about 20 minutes or until tender.
2. Whilst the potatoes are boiling, preheat the oven to 200ÂºC. Add the oil to a frying pan and fry the onion, celery and carrot over a medium heat for about 2 -3 minutes or until they soften. 
3. Add the lamb to the pan and cook for five minutes or until the lamb mince browns. 4. Stir in the tomato puree and Worcestershire sauce. Carry on stirring for a couple of minutes and then add the stock. Season to taste before leaving to simmer for five minutes. 
5. Drain the potatoes and return to the saucepan. Mash using a potato masher whilst adding the milk and butter. Continue until the mixture is smooth. 
6. Transfer the mince mixture to an ovenproof dish and top with the mashed potato. Fluff the surface using a fork to give the surface a crispy texture. 
7. Place the dish in the oven and cook for a further 20 minutes or until the potato topping turns golden brown.
