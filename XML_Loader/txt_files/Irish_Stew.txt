Ingredients:
2 1/2 lb boned mutton
4 large potatoes
2 large onions
3 or 4 medium carrots
sprig of parsley
2 cups water
salt and pepper
(serves four)


Instructions:
Cut the meat into good size chunks. Peel the vegetables and slice thickly. Chop the parsley. Choose a pot with a well-fitting lid and put in the ingredients in layers, starting and finishing with potatoes. Pour in the water and season to taste. Cover and put on a very low heat for about 2 1/2 hours until the meat is tender and the potatoes have thickened the liquid. The dish may also be made with lamb, in which case it requires only 1 1/2 hours cooking time.

Notes:
Irish stew is easy to make and if made with mutton and cooked slowly will be both flavorsome and tender. Mutton, being an older meat, has more flavor than lamb but does need to be cooked for a couple of hours over a low heat with liquid. It should not be allowed to boil or the flavor will be spoiled. There is little agreement as to the classic recipe - should there be carrots? Should the meat be browned? Should mutton, lamb, beef, bacon or even kid be used? The following dish will be found to be hearty and nourishing and traditional enough.
