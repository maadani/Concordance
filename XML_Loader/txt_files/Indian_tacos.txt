Ingredients:
Hamburger version:
	Sauce:
		1 lb hamburger
		1 large onion minced
		2 small cans tomato paste
		1 big can tomatoes
		1 tsp basil
		1/2 tsp oregano
		salt, pepper, chile powder to taste
	Topping:
:		1 head iceberg lettuce shredded
		1/2 lb cheese grated coarse
	On the counter:
		bowl of fine-chopped onion
		bowl of mild green chiles chopped up fine


Instructions:
Fry onion and hamburger broken up loose. Sprinkle some salt and chile powder over it. Add tomato paste and 4 cans of water and the canned tomatoes and their juice -- break up tomatoes and stir it around. Taste for seasoning. Simmer till meat and onions are done and sauce is thick, 30 - 40 minutes. Assembling: put the flat fry bread on a paper plate and spread sauce over it (don't be stingy). Put a handful of cheese on it and top with a handful of shredded lettuce. People add their own choices of chopped raw onion, chiles (and maybe some other favorites) from the bowls. In some areas, the culture favors the addition of hot chiles to this sauce (not in ours).
