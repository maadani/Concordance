Ingredients:
1/2 cup ( 125 mL) store-bought roasted red pepper or 1 large red pepper, roasted 
1/2 cup ( 125 mL) 4 oz pkg herbed chèvre or creamy goat cheese 
2 green onions, thinly sliced 
Instructions:
1. To roast a fresh red pepper, slice in half and remove seeds. Place cut-side down on a piece of foil set on a baking sheet. Roast, uncovered, in a 400F (200C) oven until part of skin is blackened, from 20 to 25 minutes. When cool enough to handle, peel off skin. If using prepared roasted pepper (usually sold in jars in the pickle section of supermarkets), remove enough pieces to fill a 1/2-cup (125-mL) measure when coarsely chopped. Drain well and pat dry. 

2. Place peppers in a blender or food processor. Add cheese and whirl, stopping to scrape down sides several times, until smooth. Stir in green onions. Use right away or refrigerate. 

3. Cheese mixture thickens when chilled and will keep well, covered, for at least 2 days. Use as a spread on thin slices of baguette and top with a sprig of fresh coriander, baby shrimp, a sprig of dill or a fan of snow peas. Or use as a dip with cheese straws, fruit or vegetable slices.
