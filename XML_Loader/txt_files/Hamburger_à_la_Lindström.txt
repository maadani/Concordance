Ingredients: 
500 grams ground beef 
2 egg yolks 
100 ml cream 
100 grams finely chopped onions 
150 ml finely chopped pickled red beets 
50-100 ml liquid from the pickled beets 
2 tbsp finely chopped capers 
butter for frying 
salt, pepper 

Instructions:
Proceed as follows:
Mix ground beef, egg yolks, and cream in a bowl. Add salt and pepper. Add enough liquid from pickled beets to produce a dough-like mixture. 
Sautée the chopped oinion until translucent. It must not, however, turm brownish. Add the onion to the beef mixture. 
Gently stir in pickled beets and capers. Some (but not we!) even like to add 100-150 grams boiled and mashed potatoes. 
Shape into four round patties, about the same size as a BigMac. 
Melt some butter in a frying pan. Fry the beef patties at moderate/low heat for 3-5 minutes. It is important that they remain rosy inside, otherwise they will be too dry. 
Serve together with Hasselback potatoes and iceberg lettuce.

Notes:
The origin of this dish is not entirely clear. Most believe that it was introduced by Captain Henrik Lindström (1831-1910) at Hotell Witt in Kalmar, Sweden, in the 1860s. Others suggest that the originator was Maria Kristina Lindström, who operated a delicatessen in Stockholm at about the same time. Whoever the originator, it is now almost a national dish in Sweden.
