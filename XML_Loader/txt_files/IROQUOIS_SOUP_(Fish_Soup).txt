  The Iroquois were blessed with clear, cool lakes and
  sparkling streams, and both served up an abundance of
  fish.  Fish soup, or u'nega'gei, as the Iroquois
  called it, was a favorite.  One early recipe is
  described, "Fish of any kind is boiled in a pot with a
  quantity of water. It is then removed and coarse corn
  siftings stirred in to make a soup of suitable
  consistency."  When wild onions and greens were
  available, they were usually tossed into the soup pot,
  adding both color and flavor.
