Notes:
It's an item that you won't even find on the current menu at this national restaurant chain. But ask your server what soups are available and this is a selection that's available every day of the week. The dish is one of Chili's most raved-about items, and a recipe to clone the delicious soup is easily one of the most requested here on the Internet. Looks like it's time for an official TSR custom clone to answer those many requests. The secret here is the addition of masa harina -- a corn flour that you will find in your supermarket near the other flours, or in the Mexican food section. You'll find the recipe for the pico de gallo garnish in the Chili's Nacho Burger clone recipe from last November. Enjoy, amigos!
