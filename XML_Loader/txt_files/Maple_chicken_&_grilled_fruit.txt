Ingredients:
8 skinless, boneless chicken breasts 
4 medium zucchini 
2 sweet red or green peppers 
1 pineapple or mango (optional) 
2 oranges 
1/3 cup ( 75 mL) frozen orange-juice concentrate, defrosted but undiluted 
1/3 cup ( 75 mL) maple syrup 
2 tbsp ( 30 mL) finely chopped fresh basil or 1 tsp (5 mL)dried basil 

Instructions:
1. Oil grill and preheat barbecue. Trim fat from chicken. Slice zucchini diagonally into 1/4-inch- (0.5-cm-) thick pieces. Cut peppers into quarters, then remove core and seeds. Peel, core and slice pineapple into 1/2-inch (1-cm) slices. Cut unpeeled oranges into 1/2-inch- (1-cm-) thick slices. Stir orange-juice concentrate with syrup and basil. 

2. Brush sauce over chicken and peppers. Place on grill. Barbecue until underside of chicken is golden, about 8 to 10 minutes. Turn chicken and peppers, then brush with more sauce. Add zucchini, pineapple and oranges to grill. Brush with sauce. Continue cooking until chicken is golden, fruit and zucchini are hot and peppers are tender. This will take about 8 to 10 more minutes. Turn zucchini and fruit at least once. Covered and refrigerated, chicken, vegetables and pineapple will keep well for 1 day. Oranges, however, taste best served the same day they are grilled.

The winning combination of naturally sweet maple syrup and orange juice flavors this finger-licking meal that can be cooked entirely on the grill.
