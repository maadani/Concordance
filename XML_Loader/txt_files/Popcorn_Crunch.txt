Ingredients: 
200 ml granulated sugar 
100 ml treacle (molasses) 
125 g butter 
2 l popped popcorn 
200 g salted peanuts 

Instructions:
Proceed as follows:
Mix sugar, treacle and butter in a pan. Bring to a slow boil. 
After a few minutes, by means of a teaspoon take a small sample of the boiling mixture (be careful, the mixture is very hot) and let it drip into a glass of cold water. If the mixture solidifies into a hard lump, it is ready. If not, continue the boiling and repeat the test after a few minutes. 
Add the peanuts and the popped popcorn. Mix carefully, you will have to stir forcefully for at least a minute. 
Pour the mixture onto any cold, clean metal surface and let it solidify. 
Break up the solid mass in small pieces. 
Serve the popcorn crunch in a small bowl. It will keep for days as long as there are no children (or adults) around.

Notes:
This is not a dessert, but rather a form of sweet. We got the recipe from Annmarie Santesson-Gerber (our sister/sister-in-law), presently living in the southernmost part of Sweden, where she is raising geese and lambs.
