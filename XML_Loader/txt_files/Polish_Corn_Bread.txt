Ingredients:
SOURDOUGH STARTER: 
2 c Cold water 
6 c Rye flour 
1 ts Active dry yeast 
============================ 

BREAD: 
4 c Warm water (105-110 F) 
5 1/2 c Rye flour 
5 1/2 c All purpose flour 
2 tb Salt 
4 pk Dry yeast dissolved in 1/4 cup warm water (105-110F) 
1/4 c Ground cornmeal 
2 ts Caraway seeds 
Instructions:
1. Start sourdough starter at least 3 days before baking: Combine the cold water, rye flour, and yeast in a bowl. Mix well; it will be lumpy. Pour the mixture in a clean bowl, cover with a cloth, and refrigerate for 3 days. 
2. Remove the starter from the refrigerator 2 hours before beginning to make the bread. 
3. Transfer the starter to a large bowl and add the warm water, yeast, flours, salt, cornmeal and caraway seeds and mix until smooth, 5 minutes. 
4. Divide the dough in half. Shape into 2 even rounds. Place each round in a lightly greased bowl, cover with a clean cloth, and set aside to rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1-2 hrs. 
5. Place a roasting pan on the bottom of the oven and fill with hot water. Preheat the oven to 400F. Sprinkle a baking sheet with corn- meal. 
6. Dampen your hands and reshape the bread into even round mounds. Place the loaves on a prepared baking sheet. Bake the bread until crusty, about 2 hours. If the water in the roasting pan runs low during the baking, replenish it to provide the bread with steam heat. Cool, or serve warm.
