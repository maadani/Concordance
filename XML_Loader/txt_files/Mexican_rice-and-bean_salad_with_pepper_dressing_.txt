Ingredients:
3 cups ( 750 mL) water 
1-1/2 cups ( 375 mL) long-grain rice, preferably parboiled 
1/2 tsp ( 2 mL) salt 
6 large plum tomatoes or 3 beefsteak tomatoes 
1/2 red onion 
4 green onions 
3 cups ( 750 mL) cooked black beans 
1/3 cup ( 75 mL) vegetable oil 
3 tbsp ( 45 mL) freshly squeezed lime or lemon juice 
1 tbsp ( 15 mL) toasted cumin seed (see tip below) 
1/4 to 1/2 tsp ( 1 to 2 mL) salt 
2 tbsp ( 30 mL) finely chopped pickled jalapeño peppers (see tip below) 
    or hot banana peppers 
1/4 tsp ( 1 mL) cayenne pepper (optional) 
3 cups ( 750 mL) cooked corn kernels 
1/2 cup ( 125 mL) chopped fresh coriander 

Instructions:
1. Bring water, rice and salt to a boil over high heat. Cover and immediately reduce heat to low. Simmer, without lifting lid, for 15 minutes. Then check rice. If most of water is still not absorbed, cover and cook 5 more minutes. If rice is not al dente and most of water is still not absorbed, continue cooking, covered, for another 5 minutes. Then drain. To quickly cool and dry rice, spread it out on a baking sheet and leave at room temperature. 

2. Meanwhile, seed and coarsely chop tomatoes. You should have about 3 cups (750 mL). Very thinly slice onions. Drain beans and rinse under cold running water. Drain well. In a small bowl, whisk oil with lime juice, cumin seed and salt. Finely chop jalapeños and stir in. For a truly fiery taste, whisk in cayenne as well. 

3. Turn rice into a large mixing bowl. Whisk dressing until blended and pour in. Stir until evenly coated. Then add tomatoes, onions, beans and corn. Gently stir just until mixed. Serve right away or cover and refrigerate for up to 1 day. Stir in or sprinkle with coriander just before serving.

Notes:
Slick black beans contrast with golden corn in this anything-but-boring rice salad that's jazzed up with pickled jalapeño peppers and lime juice.
