Ingredients:
1 quart veal (or chicken) velouté 
2 egg yolks 
1/2 cup heavy cream 
1-1/2 teaspoons lemon juice 
Salt to taste 
White pepper to taste 
Instructions:
Place the veloute in a saucepan and bring to a simmer; reduce very slightly.
Beat the yolks and cream together in a stainless steel bowl. Temper the liaison by slowly adding a small amount of the hot veloute; repeat until you've incorporated about a third of the sauce into the liaison. Slowly stir the liaison back into the pan.

Reheat to a very low simmer. Do not bring to a boil. Add the lemon juice, salt and pepper to taste. Strain through cheesecloth.

This is an incredibly tasty sauce!

Notes:
The classical Allemande sauce is made with veal velouté, but you can use chicken veloute if that's all you have on hand.
