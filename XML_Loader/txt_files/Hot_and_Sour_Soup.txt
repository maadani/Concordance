1/4 cup dried wood ears
1/4 cup dried tiger lily stems
1/2 cup cold water
1/2 cup bamboo shoots, shredded

6 cups Chicken Broth
2 T cider vinegar
2 T dark soy sauce

8 drops Tabasco sauce (or as much as you wish for spicy soup to balance 
flavors
1 T sesame oil
2 t chopped scallions
Instructions:
Directions:
1.  Mix the pork with sherry and 1 tsp corn starch(of the 3 TBS).
2.  Soak wood ears, mushrooms, tiger lillies with boiling water.  Cover and 
soak for 15 minutes.  Cut any of these up in a way that is desirable to you. 
 The mushrooms are the only vegetable that require cutting up.
3.  Mix the remaining cornstarch with 1/2 cup of cold water and set aside.
4.  Use a large pot which will eventually cook the soup and add oil.  Heat 
oil and add pork.  Cook several minutes until pink is gone.  Add the 
mushrooms, wood ears, tiger lillies, bamboo shoots, light soy sauce and cook 
for about 1 minute.  Add the chicken broth and dark soy sauce.  Cook until 
soup becomes well heated.  Add cider vinegar. Add bean curd
5.  As soon as the soup begins to boil stir in the well-stirred cornstarch 
mixture until the soup thickens.  Add the  Tabasco sauce.  Add Tofu.  
6.  Mix in the beaten egg, stirring constantly
7.  Taste the soup and adjust the vinegar, tabasco, soy sauce combination to 
your desire.
8.  Add the sesame oil and scallions.

NOTE:  THE KEY TO A GOOD TASTE IS THE BALANCE BETWEEN THE HOT(TABASCO), THE 
SOUR(VINEGAR), AND THE SOY SAUCE.  YOU MAY NEED TO EXPERIMENT TO FIT YOUR OWN 
TASTE.  I usually double or triple this recipe.  You can also use pepper 
instead of tabasco.
