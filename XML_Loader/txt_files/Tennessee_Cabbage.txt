Comments 
Note: You can add a touch of nutmeg for a savoury flair. You can also use the salt and pepper to taste. Also, I have used very successfully the substitution of bacon fat for the butter. I have no idea if this really is indigenous to Tennessee or not, but the person who originally gave it to me is from the city of Pulaski, Tennessee.
