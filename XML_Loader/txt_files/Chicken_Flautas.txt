Ingredients:
1 broiler-fryer (about 2 1/2 pounds), cut up 
4 cups water 
2 tablespoons lard or vegetable shortening 
1 medium-size onion, chopped (1/2 cup) 
1 clove garlic, minced 
1 tablespoon cornstarch 
1 1/4 teaspoons salt 
1/4 teaspoon pepper 
1/2 cup canned diced, mild green chilies or to taste (about 4 ounce can) 
  Vegetable oil for frying 
1 dozen fresh or thawed, frozen corn tortillas 
1 cup sour cream 
1/4 cup milk 

Instructions:
1. Bring chicken and water to boiling in kettle; lower heat; cover. Simmer until fork tender, about 25 minutes. Drain; reserve 1/2 cup broth. (Use rest in other recipes.) Cool chicken until easy to handle. Bone and skin chicken; shred meat.
2. Heat lard in a large saucepan until melted. Add onion and garlic; saute 1 minute. Stir in cornstarch, salt and pepper. Add reserved 1/2 cup broth, shredded chicken and chilies. Stir and cook until very thick and bubbly; remove from heat.
3. Heat 1/8 to 1/4 inch oil in a small skillet over medium heat until very hot. Saute tortillas one at a time, a few seconds on each side, until limp. This will soften tortillas so that they will roll up more easily. Do not cook too long or they will become crisp. Drain on paper towelling.
4. Fill each tortilla with a heaping spoonful (3 tablespoons) chicken mixture across center. Roll tortilla around filling. Be sure filling is 1 inch from edges or ends of rolled tortilla to avoid splattering during frying.
5. Place 2 or 3 flautas, seam side down, in hot oil. saute, turning on all sides, until crisp. Drain. Keep warm while cooking the rest.
6. Combine sour cream and milk in small saucepan. Heat over very low heat just until lukewarm. Spoon over flautas. Garnish with fresh coriander or cilantro leaves, if you wish.
