You can keep it hot in an olla set in sand with a ring of burning embers around it. 
Brown beef cheeks in oil, in a lage heavy pot. 
Add chopped onions and garlic, and saute until limp and yellow. 
Stir in flour thoroughly, then add chicken stock, wine, tomatoes, and tomato paste. 
Add crushed cumin seeds, salt and pepper. 
Cover and simmer until beef cheeks are tender, about 3 hours. 
Add more stock or water if necessary. 
Meantime, scrub the tongue thoroughly. 
Put in a separate kettle with the tripe. 
Add the 2 medium onions, carrot, celery, and peppercorns. Add boiling water, barely covering, and simmer, uncovered until tongue and tripe are tender, about 3 hours. 
When done drain, skin and trim tongue. 
Dice tongue and tripe and add to beef cheeks. 
It is possible to buy partially cooked tripe from your butcher. 
If not, it is a 12-hour process and should be cooked ahead of time.
