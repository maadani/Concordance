Notes:
Note: Use all your favorite condiments to top the curry, like chopped peanuts, shredded coconut, chopped green onions, raisins, or even plain yogurt! 

(Curries can be very flavorful and mild or quite zippy and hot, hot, hot! Adjust your heat with the use of chili powder and the type of chopped green chiles you use).
