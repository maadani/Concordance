Ingredients:
6 chicken pieces, about 3 lbs (1.5 kg)  
1/3 cup ( 75 mL) frozen orange-juice concentrate, defrosted but undiluted 
2 tbsp ( 30 mL) liquid honey 
2 tbsp ( 30 mL) soy sauce 
1 tsp ( 5 mL) chili powder 
1 crushed garlic clove or (1/4 tsp/1 mL) garlic powder 
1/2 tsp ( 2 mL) cayenne pepper 

Instructions:
1. Remove chicken skin, if you wish. Stir orange-juice concentrate with honey, soy, chili powder, garlic and cayenne. To precook chicken in the microwave, place bone-side down in a microwave-safe dish. Cover with waxed paper or plastic wrap, venting 1 corner. Microwave on high, turning chicken once, until chicken is just cooked, and it has no pink remaining and feels springy to the touch, about 15 to 30 minutes. If your microwave does not have a turntable, rotate dish a quarter turn every 10 minutes. 

2. Place chicken, bone-side down, on a hot greased barbecue. Grill, brushing often with orange mixture until golden, about 10 minutes per side. Or, to cook chicken entirely on barbecue, place raw chicken, bone-side down, on barbecue over low heat. Grill slowly with lid closed, turning often until almost done, about 40 minutes. Then, brush frequently with orange-juice mixture until glazed and chicken feels springy, about 10 to 20 more minutes. Covered and refrigerated, chicken will keep well for 2 days.
