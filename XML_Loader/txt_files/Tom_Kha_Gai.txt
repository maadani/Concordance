Place the chicken, lemon grass and galangal in a soup pot. Add the water and cook over medium for about 30 minutes. Add the remaining ingredients and simmer for 20 minutes. You may need to adjust the salt, sugar and water as I find the taste varies with the brand of coconut milk used. Serve with extra chilis and white rice.
