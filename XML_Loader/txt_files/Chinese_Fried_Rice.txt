Ingredients:
**  Stir Fry Ingredients  **

2 tbsp sunflower or vegetable oil
225g (8oz) Cooked long grain rice
75g (3oz) Smoked lean bacon, finely diced
75g (3oz) Peeled prawns
2 size 3 eggs, beaten
100g (4oz) Fresh or frozen peas, blanched
6 Spring Onions
Salt and freshly ground black pepper

**  To garnish  **

Spring onion tassels

Instructions:
1) Heat the oil in a large frying pan or wok, until just smoking.
Stir in the rice and stir fry for 1 minute, then add the bacon and prawns. 
Continue to cook for a further 5 minutes over a high heat.

2) Stir in the beaten eggs, peas and spring onions, and cook for a further
two minutes. Season to taste.

3) Serve piping hot, garnished with spring onion tassels.

Note: For best results, slightly undercook the rice. 
This will stop the whole thing from becoming a slodgy mess.
