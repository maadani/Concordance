Notes:
It's America's most popular pasta sauce and now you can whip up clones of two varieties at home at a fraction of the cost. Just snag yourself a large can of tomato sauce and a few other common ingredients and get simmering. These recipes duplicate the traditional "Meat" variety of the sauce and the newer "Chunky Garden Style" version with tomato, basil and Italian cheese. Feel free to doctor these sauces up with your own creative additions just as many do to perk up real Ragu.
