Ingredients: 
1 kg apples (not too ripe, not too sweet) 
50 - 100 ml water 
200 g sugar 
1 gram ascorbic acid (to prevent the apples from darkening by air oxidation) 

Instructions:
Proceed as follows:
The peeled and cored apples are cut into small pieces which are left with a little water to simmer at low heat until the pieces starten to soften up. This should not take more than 10 minutes. It is not necessary that all pieces have softened. 
Add the sugar. The quantity can be adjusted according to your preferences. Bring the mixture to a boil and mix carefully, mashing the apple pieces at the same time 
Remove the stewed and mashed apples from the heat and add the ascorbic acid. It is best first to mix the ascorbic acid with a small quantity of the apple sauce and then add this mixture to the main part of the apple sauce. 

It is best preserved deep frozen and will keep for at least half a year. It is often served together with the traditional Swedish Christmas ham or almost any other pork dish.

Notes:
Especially during the late part of the 19th century and the early days of the 20th, sugar was often used in main dishes and sweet condiments were served as side dishes. One of the few sweet condiments that goes well with meat, especially pork, is äpplemos, stewed and mashed apples
