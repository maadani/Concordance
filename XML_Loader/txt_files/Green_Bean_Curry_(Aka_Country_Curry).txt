Ingredients:
1 lb Fresh green beans 
2 tb Thai Curry Paste 
2 tb Vegetable oil 
Bamboo shoots (optional) 
6 c Chicken broth 
Instructions:
Clean and pick green bean tips. In a dutch oven (or equivalent size vessel), heat oil. Add curry paste and "fry" until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add broth, green beans, bamboo shoots (or other vegetable). Bring to a rapid boil and cook like that for about 15-20 minutes (watching that liquid doesn't reduce too much; add water as necessary). Reduce heat to a hard simmer and continue cooking until green beans are VERY done and have absorbed the flavor of the curry broth. Serve in bowls over rice. 
NOTES: If necessary, you may substitute whole frozen green beans for fresh. 
Thai Curry Paste: "Country Curry" or "Red Curry"; but they are all flavorful. Mae Ploy and Tommy Tang are other good brands. 
Bamboo shoots: I like to use a large can of bamboo tips because they are tender and I can cut them into 1/4 inch thick round slices. You can also use a couple of the small cans of sliced bamboo shoots, but they will not absorb the flavor as well. I think carrots cut into coins would also be good, if you like those. I tried potatoes once, but they just disintegrated.)
