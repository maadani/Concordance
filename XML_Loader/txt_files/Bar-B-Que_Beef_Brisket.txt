Ingredients 
8 oz (224 grm). "Tony's Cajun Seasoning" 
4 tbsp (60 ml) mustard 
2 lbs (.9 kg) light brown sugar 
1 large (bottle) Italian salad sressing (any brand ) 
1 10 to 12 lbs (5.4 kg). beef brisket (untrimed is best) 

Instructions:
Preparation 
Lay brisket on large piece of aluminium foil. 
1/4 Apply of the Tony's to each side of the brisket and rub in. 
Apply 2 tbsp (30 ml) mustard to one side and then apply another 1/4 of the Tony's over the mustard and rub in. 
Turn brisket over and repeat mustard and Tony's to the other side. 
1/2 Apply of the brown sugar so that it completely covers one side with a layer that is about 1/4 inch thick. 
Flip meat over and repeat on other side. 
With fat side of the meat facing up, pour entire bottle of Italian salad dressing over the brisket and seal tightly in the aluminium foil. 
While it can be cooked inside an oven, best results are obtained by cooking outside in a smoker. 
Cook at 400 degrees (200 C.) F for approx. 4 hours, or until done. Loosen foil and allow to "smoke" for last 30 minutes of cooking. This is also great for pork ribs!
