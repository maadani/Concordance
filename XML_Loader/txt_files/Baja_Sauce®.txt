Notes:
This is the spicy sauce that you can order on your Gordita or Chalupa at Taco Bell, but you won't get much extra sauce -- even if you order it on the side  -- to use later at home. Too bad, since this stuff is good enough to use on all sorts of homemade Mexican masterpieces, from tacos to fajitas to breakfast burritos. Now, with this original TSR clone of the creamy sauce, you'll have enough to hold you over for a while. You need a food processor to puree the vegetables, but don't expect to use all the puree. I've made the measurements for the puree larger than required so that your food processor will have something to grab onto. And, by the way, this is a mayo-based sauce, so if you want to knock down the fat grams, use light mayonnaise in the recipe. You won't even be able to tell the difference.
