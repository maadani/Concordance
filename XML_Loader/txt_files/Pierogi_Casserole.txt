1/2 box lasagna

Instructions:
This came from my friend's Pennsylvania cookbook. I tried it once and hope to try it again. It's different from anything I've had before. 
Cook 4 large potatoes. Mash and add 1/4 lb. white American cheese. Cook 1/2 box lasagna noodles and drain. Grease an oblong pan with butter. Add a little milk to prevent sticking. Fry 2 large onions in butter. Layer noodles and potatoes. Top with onions. Bake at 350 degrees for 35 minutes.
