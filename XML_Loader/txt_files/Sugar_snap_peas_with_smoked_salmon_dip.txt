Ingredients:
1/2 lb ( 250 g) smoked salmon  
1 cup ( 250 mL) light or regular sour cream 
1 tbsp ( 15 mL) drained capers 
1 tbsp ( 15 mL) chopped fresh dill 
1-1/2 tsp ( 7 mL) lemon juice 
dash of Tabasco sauce 
1-1/2 lbs ( 750 g) sugar snap peas, snow peas or green beans 

Instructions:
1. In a food processor, chop salmon using an on-and-off motion. Add remaining ingredients, except peas, and whirl until almost smooth. Taste and add more lemon juice or Tabasco, if you like. Turn into a serving dish. Use right away or cover and refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour or up to 1 day. 

2. Break off stem ends from sugar snap peas. Half fill a large saucepan with water. Bring to a full rolling boil over high heat. Place a colander in the sink. When water is boiling rapidly, add peas all at once. As soon as they are bright green, after about 30 to 45 seconds, remove from heat. Pour into colander and drain. Rinse with cold water until cool. Drain. Cover and refrigerate until dip is cold or for up to 1 day. Serve dip surrounded by peas for dipping. To pack for a picnic, half fill plastic glasses with cold dip. Stick sugar snap peas upright in dip. Cover with clear wrap.

Notes:
Sandra Watson packs crispy fresh sugar snap peas for dipping into a lemony smoked salmon dip. To make an economical dip, choose the cheaper smoked salmon ends or bits instead of the expensive thin slices.
