Ingredients:
1 lb. chinese cabbage (Napa) 
2 stalks celery 
1/2 lb. cooked shrimp 
1/2 lb. cooked pork or chicken livers 
10 water chestnuts 
1/3 cup bamboo shoots 
1 tsp. salt 
1 tsp. sugar 
Liberal dash pepper 
1/2 tsp. light soy sauce 
1/4 tsp. sesame oil 
1 beaten egg 
10 egg roll skins 
3 cups oil
Instructions:
PREPARATION:
  Boil cabbage and celery until very tender.  Drain and squeeze
out excess water.  Shred very fine and set aside to 
drain further.  Parboil shrimp and fry or bake pork.  Mince both.  Shred
water chestnuts and bamboo shoots.  Mix all ingredients but egg together. 
Beat egg.  Wrap filling in egg roll skins and seal with egg. 
 
COOKING:  Heat oil in wok or deep fat fryer to 375 degrees and drop in egg
rolls.  When skin turns light golden brown, remove from oil and drain.  (At
this point restaurants refrigerate them and finish the cooking process as
needed.)  When cool, drop again into hot    oil and fry until golden brown.
 Makes 10. 
 
The two-stage deep frying method is actually a professional Chinese chefs'
secret.  It assures that the inside will be moist and not overcooked (as
anything overcooked becomes dry) and the outside will be crisp. 
 
This recipe came from The Easy Way To Chinese Cooking by Beverly Lee.  We
have used it many times and have had a lot of success and our friends like
it too.
