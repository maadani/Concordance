Notes:
Strictly speaking, this is probably not a dish that originated in Sweden. In a Swedish cookbook from 1879 the dish is called "Risgryn med apelsin" (literally "Rice grains with orange") and the French name is given as "Riz à la Malte". Whatever the origin, it is very popular in Sweden (as well as in Denmark).
