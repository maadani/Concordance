Ingredients 
1 lb (.5 kg) crawfish tails (fresh or frozen) 
1 can cream of mushroom soup 
1 medium onion (finely chopped) 
1 bell pepper (finely chopped) 
2 ribs celery (finely chopped) 
1 can Rotel tomatoes (diced kind preferably) 
2 tbs (30 ml). Parsley 
stick margarine or butter 
4 8 oz (224 grm). shredded Cheddar cheese 
1 pkg. yellow rice (I prefer Mahatma) 

Instructions:
Preparation 
In a medium-size bowl, mix the crawfish, soup and parsley. Let sit. 
Prepare yellow rice according to the directions on the package. 
While rice it is cooking chop the onion, bell pepper and celery according to your taste. 
Melt the margarine or butter in a skillet. 
Dump in the onion, bell pepper and celery into the skillet and saut until tender. 
Add the can of Rotel tomatoes to the seasoning and simmer for about 5-10 minutes. 
Once the rice is done, add the rice to the mixture in the skillet and stir together well. 
In a large casserole dish (9 x 13 at least), dump in the rice mixture and spread out evenly. 
Spoon the crawfish & soup mixture over the top of the rice until you have evenly covered the rice. 
Then, cover the top with the cheese. 
The amount of cheese depends on your personal preference. 
Bake @ 350 F. for about 30-40 minutes or until the cheese has melted and the casserole is bubbly. 
Comments 
This can be made with shrimp, but you need to use the small shrimp. If you like milder seasoning, you can substitute regular canned tomatoes for the Rotel.
