1/3 cup orange marmalade or apricot preserves 
2 tablespoons Dijon-style mustard 
4 pork rib chops, cut 1/2 inch thick (1 to 1 1/4 pounds total)

Preheat the broiler. Meanwhile, for glaze, in a small saucepan stir together marmalade or preserves and mustard. Cook and stir over medium heat about 2 minutes or till marmalade or preserves are melted. Set mixture aside.
Trim excess fat from chops. Place the chops on the unheated rack of a broiler pan. Broil abut 4 inches from the heat for 6 minutes. Turn the chops. Broil for 2 minutes. Brush half of the glaze over the pork chops. Broil for 4 to 5 minutes more or till pork chops are no longer pink.
Spray a medium skillet with nonstick spray coating. Cook over high heat. Stir-fry onions for 2 to 3 minutes or till crisp-tender. Stir in remaining glaze; heat through. Serve mixture with chops.
