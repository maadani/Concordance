Ingredients:
2 lbs ( 1 kg) top sirloin steak, at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick 
2 tsp ( 10 mL) granulated sugar 
1 tsp ( 5 mL) freshly ground black pepper 
2 tsp ( 10 mL) ground coriander 
1/2 tsp ( 2 mL) paprika 
1/2 tsp ( 2 mL) garlic powder 
1/4 tsp ( 1 mL) cayenne pepper 

Instructions:
1. Preheat barbecue and oil grill. Place steak on a cutting board or large piece of waxed paper. In a small bowl, stir sugar with pepper and other spices. Generously sprinkle over top of steak, then turn and sprinkle other side. On thicker steaks or for maximum spiciness, heavily coat with spice mixture and rub into surface. 

2. Barbecue steak 10 minutes, then turn and continue grilling until done as you like, about 5 minutes more for medium. Serve right away with thick-cut french fries and coleslaw. This steak is also good served with zucchini and cherry tomatoes.

Notes:
A sprinkling of our powerful spice mixture gives beef a real flavor wallop. We found this dry rub works just as well on tender steak as burgers.
