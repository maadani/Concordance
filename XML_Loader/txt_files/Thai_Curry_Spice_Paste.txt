Grind the whole spices and add any ground ones. Into a food processor, pour the mixture and add the remaining ingredients (except for 1 tablespoon of the oil. Grind as fine as possible.

NOTES: Although substitutions for hard-to-find ingredients have been made, this curry paste still carries the true flavor of Thailand. Use it in Thai curries unless otherwise specified. A little added to stir-fry dishes or rubbed into chicken as a marinade before barbequing or grilling will add a real Thai accent. A teaspoon added to a meatloaf mixture or meat balls, transforms them into something that is rather exotic, and when combined with peanut butter and coconut milk, it makes a tangy and aromatic sauce for Thai-style satays. 
Use whole spices whenever possible. Anchovy fillets may be substituted for the anchovy paste. Shallots are preferable to onions; if not available, use an equal amount of a red onion.
