Ingredients:
700g stewing steak 
225g kidney 
2 small onion(s) 
225g mushrooms 
4 tblsp white flour
6 tblsp port 
45ml oil 
3/4 pint beef stock salt and ground pepper to taste 
300g self raising flour 
150g suet 
1/2 tsp salt 17ml cold water 

Instructions:
1. The basin has to be covered with greaseproof paper, tied together with string and covered using foil. Place the pudding basin onto a saucer and place into a saucepan. Fill the saucepan with boiling water until it's half way up the basin and cover. 
2. Steam for two hours, ensuring that the pan does not boil dry. 
3. Remove the foil and greaseproof paper and invert onto a plate. Serve immediately. 
4. Trim the steak and cut into cubes. Prepare the kidneys by removing the white core and cutting into chunks. Coat the meat using the plain white flour and season. 5. Heat some oil in a large frying pan and cook the steak until brown. Transfer the steak to a casserole dish and add the kidneys to the frying pan. Once the kidneys have browned, add to the casserole. 
6. Add the onions to the frying pan and cook for around 10 minutes before transferring to the casserole along with the port and beef stock. 
7. Bring the casserole to the boil and simmer for about 1 1/4 hours. 
8. The pastry is made by sifting the flour into a bowl, stirring in the suet and adding the salt. Add a little water so that the mixture can be kneaded into a soft dough. 
9. Roll about 3/4 of the dough on a flour covered surface and line a pudding basin (about 3 pints or 1.7 litres). 
10. Mix the mushrooms in with the steak and add to the pudding basin. Moisten the pastry edges by brushing with water. Roll out the rest of the pastry into a lid and place on top of the pudding. Seal with by pinching the edges with the fingers.
