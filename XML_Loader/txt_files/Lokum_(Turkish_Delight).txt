Ingredients:
2 1/2 c Water 
4 c Sugar 
1 c Cornstarch 
3/4 c Grape juice or orange juice 
1 ts Cream of tartar 
Instructions:
Few drops red food coloring (optional) Oil Powdered sugar 
Bring the water to a boil, add the sugar and stir until thoroughly dissolved. Mix the cornstarch with the juice and cream of tartar. Gradually pour into the boiling syrup, stirring constantly. Continue cooking for 20 min, stirring frequently to prevent sticking. Add food coloring. Oil a 7" square cake pan with sides 1 to 1 1/2" high. Pour in the mixture and let stand until cool and set. Cut into 1" squares. Dust with powdered sugar and serve. 
Serves:
6
Notes:
It takes a bit of trial and error to gauge when the lokum mixture is ready. If it boils too long it will turn out hard like toffee, and if it is too soft it will not keep its shape when cool. It should feel soft but firm after cooling
