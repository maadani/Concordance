Ingredients:
3 lb/1.5 kg  chicken 
  salt 
2 ounces/50g plain flour 
4 ounces/100g lard 

Instructions:
1. Ask your butcher to joint the chicken into 8 pieces. This can be done by dividing the bird into drumstick and thigh, wing and breast, leaving a little breast on the wing joints.
2. Rinse the chicken and pat dry with kitchen paper, then sprinkle well with salt.
3. Toss each piece in the flour coating it well, then tap to remove excess.
4. Melt the lard in a large frying pan over a high heat and when it gives off a slight haze, add the leg and thigh pieces, skin side down.
5. Cover the pan and fry the chicken over a moderate heat for about 8 minutes, making sure it does not burn.
6. When it is deep golden on one side, turn it over, cover the pan and fry the other side until golden.
7. Drain well on kitchen paper, transfer it to the shelves of the oven to keep hot while you fry the remaining pieces.
8. Serve this traditional American dish in a napkin-lined basket with a mixed slad.
