Ingredients:
2 pounds scrag neck of lamb 
6 peppercorns 
1 bay leaf 
Few parsley stalks 
1 blade mace 
1 inch cinnamon stick 
4 ounces unsalted butter 
  Ground mace 
  Salt 
  Pepper 

Instructions:
Rinse the meat and put it in a large casserole with the peppercorns, bay leaf, parsley stalks, blade of mace and cinnamon stick. Pour in 1/2 pint cold water. Cover the casserole and cook the meat in a moderate oven (325 degrees) for 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Remove the herbs and spices, drain off and keep the stock. Pull the meat from the bones and blend with enough of the reserved stock to moisten it to a paste. Or mince the meat twice, then add the stock. Melt 1 ounce butter in a small pan, add to the lamb with plenty of ground mace and salt and pepper to season. Pack into small dishes and chill until firm. Melt the remaining butter and pour a little over the top of each dish. Allow to set and serve with toast, 1 ounce slice per person.
