Ingredients:
1 lb. cooked and cooled pasta (I use tri color twist trio for color)
1 lb. sliced pepperoni
2- 1/2" thick slices (from deli) hard salami, cubed
2- 1/2" thick slices (from deli) provolone cheese, cubed
1 jar green olives
1 can pitted small black olives
1 small onion, chopped
1 large tomato, chopped

Dressing:

1/2 cup balsamic or red wine vinegar
2/3 cup olive oil
1 tbsp. basil
1 tbsp. oregano
1 tsp. salt
1 tsp. pepper
Instructions:
Combine all ingredients in large tupperware container. (I use tupperware as you need a tight cover) Pour dressing over mixture and seal container. Marinate for several hours or overnight. I usually sprinkle a little more vinegar on before serving to wet it again as the pasta and tomatoes absorb quite a bit.

0
Notes:
This one is requested wherever I go - I've also turned it into kabobs when the occasion is less casual
