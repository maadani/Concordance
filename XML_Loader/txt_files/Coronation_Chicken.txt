15ml tomato puree

300ml mayonnaise 
120ml cream 
15ml apricot jam 
1 bay leaf

Instructions:
1. Select a saucepan into which the chicken will fit. Cut the lemon in half and stuff into the chicken cavity. Place the chicken into the saucepan and add the bouquet garni, vegetables and season with the salt and pepper. 
2. Fill the saucepan with water until it covers 2/3 of the chicken and then bring to the boil. Cover and cook the chicken for 1 1/2 hours, until the chicken's juices run clear. 3. Once the chicken is cooked, transfer to a large bowl and cover with the liquid from the saucepan. Once the chicken has cooled, skin and bone the chicken. Then cut into small pieces.
