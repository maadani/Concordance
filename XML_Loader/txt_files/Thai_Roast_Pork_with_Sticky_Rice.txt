Ingredients:
3 c Uncooked sticky rice 
6 c Very warm (almost hot) water 
4 tb Oil 
1 1/2 lb Pork roast 
2 tb Oyster sauce 
5 tb Sugar 
1 tb Thai dark sweet soy sauce 
2 1/2 tb Light soy sauce 
3 tb Whiskey (optional) 
1/4 c Chopped cilantro leaves 
1/2 c Chopped green onions 
3 md Cucumbers; sliced 
2 lg Tomatoes; sliced 
Sliced fresh chilies to taste 
Instructions:
Wash and pat dry the pork. Slice into large pieces--about 1" thick. Poke both sides of each piece with a fork or skewer and place in a flat bottom container with lid. Blend oyster sauce, sugar, the two soys and whiskey well. Pour over the pork and mix. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator at least 1 hour. Overnight for best result. Soak sticky rice in water for 30 mins and drain well. Pour rice in a wet-paper towel lined steamer and steam over high heat for 40-45 minutes. Place cooked rice in a container and mix with the oil to coat well. Cover and set aside. Charcoal grill the pork over medium heat until well done. Drizzle some of the marinating liquid on each side halfway through the cooking time. In a small sauce pan, bring the rest of marinating liquid to a boil and pour into a gravy bowl. Slice pork into 1" X 1 1/2" pieces and about 1/4" thick. Spread the rice onto a platter. Cover with the pork pieces and pour the marinating liquid over the pork. Sprinkle cilantro, green onions and chilies. Garnish with sliced cucumbers and tomatoes.
