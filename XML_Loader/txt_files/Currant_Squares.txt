Instructions:
To make pastry: freeze butter or margarine for half an hour before grating. Sift flour and salt, then add butter or margarine. Mix into flour with palette knife. Add iced water until a dough is formed. Wrap and chill in fridge. Put all filling ingredients into a saucepan and bring to boiling point. Set aside to cool. Preheat oven to gas mark 6/ 200°C/ 400°F. Roll out half the pastry very thinly and line a Swiss roll tin. Pour on currant filling, spreading evenly, then cover with the rest of the pastry. Glaze with egg or milk and bake for 30 minutes or until light gold in colour. Dust with caster sugar and cut into squares when cool. 

Even in the age of convenience foods, home baking skills are flourishing, though the preference has shifted from large cakes to tray bakes. Here is an unsurpassed favourite, especially when made with a delicate flaky pastry.
