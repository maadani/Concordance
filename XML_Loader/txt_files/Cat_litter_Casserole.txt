Ingredients:
1 c  Bisquick
      1 c  Shredded Cheddar cheese
      1 lb Ground beef, turkey or pork
           Sausage


      2 c  Long grain rice
  3 3/4 c  Water
      2 ts Salt
      2 tb Butter or margarine

Instructions:
preheat the oven to 350F. Using
  clean hans, mix together the dump ingredients in a large bowl. Mold
  pieces of this mixture into various size/shape dumps.
 
  Place so they don't touch each other in an un greased baking pan. Use
  two if they don't all fit. With an adult's help, bake the dumps for
  about 20 minutes or until they are all brown, firm and slightly
  crusty.
 
  While the meat cooks, put all four litter ingredients into a large
  saucepan. Then, with an adult's help, heat on high until the water
  comes to a boil. Stir, turn heat to low and cover the pan. Simmer
  without lifting the cover for fourteen minutes.
 
  With an adult's help, remove the saucepan from the stove and
  carefully (to avoid having your face melted away by the steam), lift
  off the cover. Break apart, or "fluff" the rice with a fork and set
  pan aside.
 
  When dumps are done, carefully transfer them onto paper towels to
  drain.
 
  Spoon the rice and dumps into the now empty baking pan, leaving some
  dumps partially uncovered, the way Kitty does when he/she is in a
  hurry. Serves 8-10 litter box lovers. Use pooper scooper to serve.
