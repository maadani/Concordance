Ingredients:
4  cups flour 
1  cup whole wheat flour 
1 1/2  teaspoons baking powder 
16  fluid ounces club soda 

Instructions:
Combine flour, whole wheat flour and baking powder in a large bowl. Add club soda and mix to a smooth, thin batter. 

Heat a large nonstick skillet. Add a small amount of batter; tilt pan to cover the bottom. Batter should spread out over pan thinly. (Add up to 2 more tablespoons of whole wheat flour if the mixture is too thin.) 

When moisture has evaporated and small bubbles appear on surface of bread, remove from pan. Bread should be cooked on one side but not browned. 

Pile breads onto a large platter, covering with a towel until ready to serve.

Cooking Tips
Teff flour can often be purchased at Ethiopian, Eritrean and Somali markets. Substitute it for the whole wheat flour.

Notes:
Ethhiopian Flat Bread, or injera, is traditionally made with a grain called teff, common to Ethiopia. Instead of baking soda or powder, Ethiopian cooks use a fermentation process for leavening. Made in flat rounds resembling large buckwheat pancakes, this spongy, moist bread is often 15 inches across. Injera is used to pick up bits of meat and vegetables at Ethiopian meals -- no silverware is used.
