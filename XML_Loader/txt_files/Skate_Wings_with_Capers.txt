Ingredients: 
400 - 500 g skate wings (2 - 4 pieces) 
25 - 50 g capers 
Dijon mustard, salt 
25 - 50 g butter 
Instructions:
Proceed as follows:
First prepare the "nutbrown butter" (beurre noisette): Melt butter and continue to heat it rather slowly until it has acquired a dark golden brown colour and small dark brown grains of deep fried proteins begin to appear. 
Place the skate wings on a suitable glass or ceramic form with the thickest part facing outwards. Add some salt and cover the skate wings with a very thin layer of Dijon mustard. 
Cover with plastic wrap and cook in the microwave oven at full heat (700 W) for one minute per 100 g skatewings. 
Remove the plastic wrap, strew capers generously over the wings and serve together with the nutbrown butter. Carefully decant the butter over the skatewings, leaving the fried protein behind. 
Almost any source of "slow carbohydrates", be it potatoes, fresh pasta or rice can be served as a side dish.

Notes:
Before arriving in The Hague we had actually never eaten skate in any form, but skate wings (rogvleugels) soon became a favourite dish, not the least because of the stimulating effects of this fish.
The "bones" (which are not bones but cartilage) are so few and easy to manage that it would be a pleasure even for a small child. Usually we prepare the skate wings according to the following recipe, based on Bocuse's "Regional French Cooking".
