Ingredients:
Ingredients: 
200 grams feta cheese (preferably in brine) 
10 grams (3 medium-sized cloves) garlic 
2 grams fresh basil (6 4-cm leaves) (some might prefer to use less basil) 
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil OR 
3 tbsp creme fraiche (sour cream
Instructions:
Proceed as follows:
Purée the feta cheese, cut into small cubes, the garlic and the basil leaves in the food processor. 
Add either the olive oil or the creme fraiche and continue puréing until you have a smooth paste.
The dip mix based on olive oil is the original one. Substituting olive oil by creme fraiche results in a dip mix with a softer taste and smoother texture. Both forms have plenty of applications in the hors d'oevre context. They will keep for up to week in the refrigerator but usually they have been devoured long before that. Deep-freezing is possible, especially of the creme fraiche based dip.

Notes:
The starting point for this recipe came from Maiken Karlsson who, in turn, had picked it up from a hotel in Umeå, Sweden. As usual, we began experimenting and, after a while and many attempts, came up with an alternative composition. The dip mix can be used, inter alia, as a spread, together with tortilla chips, as a stuffing for mushroom caps and in canapés. A similar dip mix has also been included in our collection of aphrodisiac recipes.
