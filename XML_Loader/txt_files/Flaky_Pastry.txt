Ingredients:
2 cups flour 
1/4 tsp salt 
1/2 - 2/3 cup water 
1/4 tsp lemon juice 
2/3 cup butter 

Instructions:
Sift flour and salt, mix water and lemon juice. Soften shortening slightly with a knife and divide into 4 equal portions. Rub one portion of shortening into flour. Mix into a dough with the water and lemon juice. Turn onto a floured board and knead lightly until pastry is smooth and pliable. Roll pastry into rectangular shape.

Flake one portion of shortneing on top two thirds of rectangle. Fold in three by placing the lower third over center third, and top over lower third. Rest pastry in refrigerator for 5 minutes.

Turn pastry so that the folded edge is to the left. Press rolling pin at intervals along pastry, thus evening the shortening. Roll out again, rolling away from you to keep the layers of flakes even in the pastry. Use short light strokes and keep the pastry in good rectangular shpae. Rest pastry in the refrigerator between each rolling and folding.

Proceed as before until the remaining portions of shortening have been used. Cover and place pastry in refrigerator until needed.
