Notes:
Red cabbage is a traditional dish, together with the ham, on Christmas Eve for many Swedish families. But it is also often served outside the Cristmas season, together with ham, pork, spare ribs or similar types of meat. Canned cooked red cabbage is commercially available, but does not compare with the real stuff!
