450g golden syrup 
75g white breadcrumbs 
1/4 tsp ground ginger 
2 tsp lemon juice 
Finely grated rind of 1 lemon 
225g plain white flour 
100g butter 
1 egg(s) 

Instructions:
1. Make the pastry using the egg, flour and butter. Line a tart tin with two thirds of the pastry and prick the base using a fork. 
2. Preheat the oven to 190ÂºC and transfer the tin and remaining pastry(covered in grease proof paper) to the fridge for about 30 minutes. 
3. Add the golden syrup, breadcrumbs, ginger, lemon rind and juice to a mixing bowl and mix together. 
4. Then allow the mixture to thicken before adding it to the tart tin. 
5. Roll out the remaining pastry and cut into 1cm wide strips. Arrange these strips over the tart to form a lattice. Brush the ends of the strips with a little milk and attach to the pastry rim. 
6. Brush the remaining strips with milk and transfer to the oven and bake for 30 minutes. Serve hot or cold with cream.
