Ingredients: 
100 grams of cooked and deshelled mussels (see the basic recipe) 
500 ml (2 cups) of saffron-spiced mussel bouillon (see the basic recipe) 
100 grams rice vermicelli, broken down into short pieces 

Instructions:
Proceed as follows:
Bring the bouillon to a boil. 
Add the rice vermicelli pieces and cook at a low heat for 3 minutes. Some varieties of vermicelli might require a slightly shorter or longer cooking time. 
Add the mussels and heat (but do not boil) for a minute or two. 
Optional improvement: Before serving, add two tablespoons of cognac to the soup. 
A dry white wine with a lot of taste goes nicely with the soup. However, even a light Riesling can be appropriate.

Notes:
The starting point for this recipe is the Basic Aphrodisiac Mussels. Actually, the dish was originally not developed as an aphrodisiac but for dietary purposes. Because of intestinal cancer, Johan was on a very restricted diet. This dish turned out to be quite acceptable to his digestion, while at the same time tasting "just like gourmet restaurant food", according to Anne.
