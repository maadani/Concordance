Ingredients: 
60 ml vodka or 
25 ml lab alcohol (96 %) and 
35 ml water 
60 ml lingonberry juice 

Instructions:
Proceed as follows:
Mix equal parts of vodka and lingonberry juice in a shaker with plenty of ice. Shake and serve! 
Even better is to mix without ice and leave the mixture in the refrigerator for a few hours. Thus you avoid an unnecessary dilution, but that requires careful planning

Notes:
Hard liquor is very expensive in Sweden. This means that some chemists turn to laboratory alcohol in order to their expenses at a more reasonable level. Vargtass is one favourite way of making use of the tax-free lab alcohol.
