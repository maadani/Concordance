Notes:
Yet another memory of the summers in New York. At Caliente Cab (inter alia situated at the corner of 7 Ave. and Bleecher Street) brunch was served during the weekend under the motto "Drink 'til you drop". $ 7 bought you a main course and an unlimited supply of frozen Margaritas which you consumed using a very special form of drinking straw, similar to what is used in hospitals for patients who cannot raise their heads anymore. A coincidence? Maybe.
