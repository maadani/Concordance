Ingredients:
8 large green balmain bugs or 2 large green lobster tails 

Mango Sauce
1 large or 2 small mangoes 
2-3 TBSP sour cream 
1/4 cup lemon or lime juice 
1 tsp soft brown sugar 
2-3 tsp Thai sweet chili sauce 


Instructions:
Lower bugs into large pan of lightly salted boiling water. Simmer uncovered for 4-5 minutes or until shells have changed to an orange red color. Gently separate the heads from the bodies. Use a pair of sharp kitchen scissors to cut along the soft underside of the bugs. Pull shell apart and ease out the flesh. Cut each piece of flesh in half, lengthways. To make the mango Sauce, peel the mango(s), remove the seeds and roughly chop flesh. Place flesh in a food processor. Add sour cream, juice, sugar and sauce. Process for 20-30 seconds or until smooth. Refrigerate, covered, until needed. If the sauce is too thick, add a little extra cream or juice.
