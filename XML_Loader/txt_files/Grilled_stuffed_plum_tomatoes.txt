Ingredients:
7 large plum tomatoes 
1 tsp ( 5 mL) olive oil 
1 cup ( 250 mL) crumbled feta  
2 tbsp ( 30 mL) finely chopped fresh mint or basil or basil pesto 
1/4 tsp ( 1 mL) freshly ground black pepper 

Instructions:
1. Lightly grease grill and preheat barbecue to high. Halve tomatoes lengthwise. Squeeze out juice and seeds. Using a knife, cut out centre pulp from halves, forming tomato shells. Finely chop pulp and place in a bowl. Finely chop 2 tomato halves, then add to bowl. Brush remaining tomato halves all over with oil. Place on grill, cut-side down, over high heat. Barbecue, without turning, until marked on cut side, about 5 minutes. 

2. Meanwhile, stir feta, mint and pepper into tomatoes in bowl. After 5 minutes of grilling, remove tomato halves. Spoon tomato-cheese mixture into hollow of each grilled tomato half, pressing filling gently. Place tomatoes back on grill, filling-side up. Cover and grill until tomatoes are hot, from 4 to 5 minutes. Alternatively, cook tomatoes, bottom-side up, on a greased baking sheet in a 450F (230C) oven for 5 minutes. Turn, add cheese mixture, then broil until cheese is tinged with brown, about 1 minute.
