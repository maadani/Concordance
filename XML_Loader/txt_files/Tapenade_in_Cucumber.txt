Ingredients: 
250 g black olives without stones 
100 g garlic 
100 g anchovy in olive oil 
80 g drained capers 
60 - 70 ml olive oil (if possible extra virgin olive oil) 
freshly ground black pepper 
cucumber 
Ritz crackers (or similar circular, salty crackers) 

Instructions:
Proceed as follows:
First, prepare the tapenade. Puree the olives, garlic, anchovy and capers in a food processor until you have a smooth paste of an unappetizing colour. 
Add the olive oil, continue processing for a short while, and the tapenade is ready. 
Cut off one end of the cucumber and remove the seeds using a narrow knife. 
Fill the hollowed cucumber with tapenade. 
Press a cracker against the cucumber end, cut off a slice of the cucumber and catch the slice on the cracker. Repeat the procedure until you have enough crackers, each covered with a tapenade-filled cucumber slice. 
Serve together with a frozen margarita or other suitable drink. Any tapenade that is left will keep for at least a week in the fridge and can be used in many contexts, e.g. as a spread on "knäckebröd".

Notes:
Tapenade is in itself a delicacy. But served together with crispy cucumber it becomes even better, thanks to the differences in texture, the smooth tapenade contrasting the crunchy cucumber. And together with a cracker, it can be served as a snack before dinner.
