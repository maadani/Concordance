Ingredients:
4 whole trout 
1 tbsp chopped fresh thyme 
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil 
salt and pepper 

Fennel Butter: 
2 tsp fennel seeds 
125g/4oz butter, softened 
1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley 
2 tsp lemon juice
Instructions:
1. Wash and dry the trout inside and out and using a sharp knife make 
several slashes on each side. Mix together the thyme leaves, oil and some 
salt and pepper and rub over the fish making sure the flavourings are 
pressed well into the slashes. Marinate for at least 1 hour. 
2. Meanwhile, make the butter. Toast the fennel seeds in a dry frying pan until they turn golden and release their aniseed aroma. Cool slightly and grind to a fine powder in a spice mill or pestle and mortar. 
3. Beat into the butter with the parsley, lemon juice and some pepper. Chill until required. 
4. Brush the fish with a little extra oil and cook on a hot barbecue for 3-4 
minutes each side until charred and cooked through. Rest for five minutes and serve with the fennel butter and a tomato and olive salad.
