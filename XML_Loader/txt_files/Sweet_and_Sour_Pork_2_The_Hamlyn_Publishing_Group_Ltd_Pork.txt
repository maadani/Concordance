Cut the pork into small shreds. Mix 1 tablespoon soy sauce with the sherry and a pinch of sugar. Peel and finely chop the onion and add with the soy sauce mixture to the pork.

Peel and finely shred the carrot. Beat the egg well. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a small pan and fry the carrot pieces for 2 minutes, stirring all the time.
