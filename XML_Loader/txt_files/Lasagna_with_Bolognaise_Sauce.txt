Ingredients:
/2 lbs instant lasagna sheets 
1 1/2 tbsp butter 
1 1/2 tbsp flour 
1 cup milk X salt and pepper to taste 
1/2 cup chopped onions 
1 tbsp chopped garlic 
1/4 cup chopped carrots 
1 cup tomato sauce
1/2 Lb ground beef
2 tbsp red wine 
1/2 cup chicken or beef stock 
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
Instructions:
Cook lasagna according to package directions, drain. Rinse with cold water, drain again and set aside. 

WHITE SAUCE: 
In a saucepan, melt butter over low heat. With a wooden spoon, stir in the flour until a thick paste forms. Add in the milk, and mix until smooth. Cook 10 to 12 minutes, simmering until thick and smooth. Simmer for 2-3 minutes more to remove the flour taste. Season with the salt and pepper. 

BOLOGNAISE SAUCE: 
In a sauce pan, saute chopped onions and garlic in olive oil until onion is translucent. Add carrots and continue cooking for about 2 minutes. Add the ground beef and cook until the meat is done and crumbly. Add red wine, stock, and tomato sauce and simmer until the sauce is thick (about 10 minutes). Season with salt and pepper. In a lightly greased oven-proof dish, spread the Bolognaise sauce at the bottom. Add the white sauce and top with the lasagna sheets. Repeat layers until all ingredients are used, ending with a layer of lasagna sheets on top. Spread mozzarella cheese evenly on top. In a preheated oven, bake for 20 minutes at 350 Â°F until the top is golden. Serve with garlic bread if desired .
