This recipe was e-mailed to us by Claudia M. Villar, a netwriting student from EF Internet School. "I remember in winter when I came back from the school," she writes, "and my mother was waiting with a big potato pie for me and my brother. It's delicious, specially when it's cold because this a meal with many calories." It is really worth trying!
