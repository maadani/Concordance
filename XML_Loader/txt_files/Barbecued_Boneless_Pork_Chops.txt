Ingredients:
4 (1 3/4 pounds) thick boneless pork chops 
2 tablespoons butter or margarine 
2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley 
1 tablespoon chopped onion 
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger 
1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper 
 dash salt 
1 red pepper, sliced 
1 green pepper, sliced 

Instructions:
1. Rinse pork chops. Pat dry.

2. Make a pocket horizontally in each chop with a sharp knife.

3. Combine butter, parsley, onion, ginger, pepper and salt.

4. Stuff pork chops with mixture, dividing evenly among chops.

5. Press cut ends together and secure with a few wooden toothpicks.

6. Place chops in preheated barbecue/broiler.

7. Grill chops, basting with melted butter once on each side. Grilling time is about 10 minutes per side. Chops should be nicely brown and cooked to juiciness, but not over-cooked.
