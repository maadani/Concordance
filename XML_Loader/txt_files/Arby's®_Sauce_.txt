Notes:
Although the beef sandwiches from Arby's would be very hard to duplicate since they are made from specially processed beef hunks, thinly sliced, this fast food chain's barbecue sauce can be cloned easily. Now you can whip up this slightly tangy sauce to put on your own homemade sandwich creations, even barbecued ribs or chicken
