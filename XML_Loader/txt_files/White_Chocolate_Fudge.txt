Notes:
I suppose you can substitute maraschino cherries for the dried apricots. Just make sure to drain the cherries before adding them. Use only white chocolate squares, such as Bakers or Nestles. Don't use the white chocolate chips. To remove the marshmallow cream from the jar, take off lid and seal and microwave on High for 30 seconds.
