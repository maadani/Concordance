Notes:
Easter Bread is consumed on Easter Sunday to break the Lenten Fast and used for forty days after Easter. Marie is one of Chuda's Children from Kenai. This recipe is not the traditional one because of the addition of peels and cardamom, which was not available in the villages. The rest is similar. This is a wonderful Easter Bread.
The brightest and most colorful eggs are made by using vinegar, boiling water and Wilton's food coloring paste. I recommend wearing rubber gloves because this dye tends to stain your hands.
