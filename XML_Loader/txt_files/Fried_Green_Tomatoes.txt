Yield: 6 servings
2 lb Green tomatoes
4 ea Eggs
1 1/4 cups  Corn meal
3/4 cup  Water
1/4 cup  Minced chives
1 tbl Salt
1/4 tsp Pepper, fresh ground
1/4 cup  Butter or margarine

Instructions:
Slice the tomatoes 1/2 inch thick, but do not peel or core.  Drain   well between several thicknesses of paper toweling until most of the   moisture of the tomatoes is absorbed.  While the tomatoes are   draining, make a batter by beating the eggs until light, then mixing   in the corn meal, water, minced chives, salt and pepper.  In a large,   heavy iron skillet, heat the butter or margarine until bubbly.  Dip   the tomato slices into batter, and brown quickly on both sides. Serve   at once.
