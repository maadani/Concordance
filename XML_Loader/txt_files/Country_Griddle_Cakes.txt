Notes:
This nationwide chain, which is known for it's big bargain breakfasts, serves an impressive number of non-breakfast items as well. In 1997, I.H.O.P. dished out over 6 million pounds of french fries and over half a million gallons of soft drinks. But it's the Country Griddle Cakes on the breakfast menu that inspired this Top Secret Recipe. The unique flavor and texture of this clone comes from the Cream of Wheat in the batter. Now you can have your pancakes, and eat your cereal too.
