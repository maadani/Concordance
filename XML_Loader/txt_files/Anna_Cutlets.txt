Notes:
"Allt om Mat" is a leading Swedish food magazine. We were immensely proud when it published our recipe for Anna cutlets in the early 1970s. (We also appreciated when the magazine, 25 years later, included a link to our recipe collection - see AoM #17, 1997.) It is a very convenient dish, can be prepared long in advance with everything contained in one pot.
