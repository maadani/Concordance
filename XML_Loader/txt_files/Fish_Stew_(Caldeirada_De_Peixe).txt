3 ts Piri-piri sauce see recipe 
1 sm Glass dry white wine 
1 Handful coriander leaves; chopped 
4 Slices of bread with the crusts cut off 
Instructions:
This is a real fisherman's stew, dependent on whatever the boats have brought in. The spices and hervs give the dish its special Portuguese identity. 
Clean the fish and cut into fairly small pieces, removing as many bones as possible. Sprinkle the salt over the fish and leave while you make the following sauce. Heat 2-3 Tbsp of the oil in a saucepan and stir in the onions, tomatoes and pepper. Cook gently until they start to soften, then put in the garlic, nutmeg, allspice and piri-piri sauce. Add the wine and a little water. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently, then remove from the heat. Lightly oil the bottom of a shallow, ovenproff dish (preferably earthenware). Put in a layer of fish followed by a layer of sauce and sprinkle with coriander. Continue with these layers until the ingredients are used up. Cover the top of with the bread and sprikle well with the remaining oil or dot with a little butter. Cook in a pre-heated oven at 350 degrees F. for about 30 minutes or until the fish is tender. Serve with boiled or sliced and fried potatoes, bread and a slad to make a substantial main meal. If you cannot obtain coriander leaves, you can use fresh parsley instead, but this will alter the flavour of the dish.
