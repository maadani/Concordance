Ingredients: 
4 slices pork sirloin, 1/2 - 3/4 lb. each (about 1 inch thick) 
1 egg, beaten 
2 cups bread crumbs 
1 cup flour 
Peanut or canola oil for deep frying 

1 lemon (optional) 
Hot yellow mustard 

Tonkatsu sauce or subsititute

Use your favorite steak sauce and mix with ketchup to sweeten. You can also mix in lemon juice, to add a touch of sourness. A-1 or 76 steak sauce, or even Worcestershire sauce alone, goes well, too. 
Garnish 

Thin slices of cabbage or lettuce leaves. 
To prepare cabbage slices: Thin-slice 8 cabbage leaves and soak in cold water. Drain well and use them as a garnish for the tonkatsu. 

Instructions:
This recipe also works very well with beef, chicken, oysters, and large shrimps or prawns.

Japanese-style potato salad [recipe here at this site] goes very well with this dish. Coleslaw would be nice, too. Also, Japanese or Chinese yellow (hot) mustard can give some sensation to your taste buds. 

Here are the ingredients and directions. You can prepare biifu-katsu (beef cutlet) using the same directions. 

Directions:

Tenderize the meat and flatten to about 1/2 inch thick. Season the pork with salt and pepper. Coat the meat with flour and shake off the excess. Dip the meat into the egg, then the bread crumbs on a platter. Chill the meat in the freezer for 20 minutes or in the refrigerator for 2 hours. This chilling process gives the tonkatsu a crispy crust. Deep-fry (350F) until each side is light to medium golden brown. Drain the oil well and serve with the garnish. Slices of tomato will add some color.
Serves:
4
Notes:
To tonkatsu-fry seafood or other types of meat, follow the same directions. Of course, you have to peel the shells of shrimps. Oysters are our favorite choice. In Japan a bowl of miso soup usually comes with this dish. Bon Appetit!
