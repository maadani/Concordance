Type:

Ingredients:
8 Chinese or Japanese shiitake mushrooms soaked in 1 cup hot water for 20 -30 minutes, or until soft 
3-3 1/2 pound chicken, washed and cut into 8 -10 pieces 
2 scallions, cut into 2" lengths (green part only) 
2 thin slices ginger, peeled 
2 cups Chinese cabbage (also called celery or lettuce cabbage), cut into 1" pieces 
1 cup chicken broth 
1 tablespoon reduced-sodium soy sauce 

Instructions:
1. Squeeze the mushrooms dry. Remove the stems and cut into quarters. Strain the liquid and set aside.
2. In a deep bowl arrange the chicken, mushrooms, scallions, ginger, and cabbage. Combine the chicken broth with the reserved mushroom liquid and soy sauce. Pour over the ingredients in the bowl.
3. Fit the bowl in a large pot filled with 2" to 3 " of hot water with a rack supporting the bowl. Cover the pot and cook the chicken over medium-high heat for about 1 1/2 hours, or until the chicken is tender and firm, but not falling apart. ( The water level should be checked every 30 minutes to maintain constant steam, but if you remove the lid too often the escaping steam will slow the cooking process.)
If cooking in a Yunnan pot, arrange the chicken around the cone, top with the remaining ingredients, cover the pot, and place over a large saucepan of boiling water. Cook over medium-high heat for 1 to 2 hours.
4. Remove the chicken from the pot, pull off the chicken skin, and discard along with ginger. Skim fat from pan juices. Replace chicken in bowl and serve.
Note: AYunnan pot is a round earthenware pot with a cone in the center that tapers to a small hole at the top, used for seaming food. the same process can be achieved just as easily by using a deep bowl placed on a rack in a deep kettle. If possible, cook the broth with the scallion and ginger for 20 minutes before cooking the recipe. Strain the broth and proceed with the recipe.
