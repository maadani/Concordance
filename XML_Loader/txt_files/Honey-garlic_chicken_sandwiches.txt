Ingredients:
4 skinless boneless chicken breasts 
1/4 cup ( 50 mL) frozen orange-juice concentrate, defrosted but undiluted 
2 tbsp ( 30 mL) each of soy sauce and honey 
1 tsp ( 5 mL) lemon pepper 
1 large garlic clove, crushed 
4 multi-grain rolls or crusty buns 
1 arugula or radicchio (optional) 

Instructions:
1. Oil grill and preheat barbecue. Lay chicken breasts on a piece of waxed paper. With the bottom of your fist, gently pound, flattening slightly. In a small bowl, stir orange-juice concentrate with soy, honey, lemon pepper and garlic. 

2. Place chicken on preheated grill. Brushing often with orange mixture, barbecue until glazed, golden and springy to the touch, about 5 to 8 minutes per side. Meanwhile, slice buns and line with several pieces of arugula. Remove chicken to a cutting board and slice each breast, diagonally, into 3 or 4 pieces. Place in arugula-lined rolls.

Notes:
On muggy days when appetites wilt, offer up grilled chicken sandwiches. Ours take only 20 minutes from start to finish. Top with sliced mangoes, tomatoes and cucumbers.
