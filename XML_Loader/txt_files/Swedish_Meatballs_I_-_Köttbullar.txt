For meatballs in a brown gravy, fry the meatballs in four batches. After each of the first three batches add 3-4 tbsp of water to the skillet, stir and pour the water into a separate vessel.

Notes:
There are almost as many recipes for Swedish meatballs as there are Swedish amateur chefs. The three main types are: (1) small, fried, served without sauce; 
(2) large, fried, served in brown gravy; 
(3) medium size, boiled, served in sauce. 
The present recipe is a very simple version of type-1 meatballs, a childrens favourite.
