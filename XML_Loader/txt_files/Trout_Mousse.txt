Ingredients: 
500 grams trout (or other salmon type fish) 
100 grams boiled potatoes 
150 ml freshly pressed lemon juice 
3 tbsp cognac 
2 tbsp molten butter 
2 avocados 
cayenne pepper 
black pepper, salt 

Instructions:
Proceed as follows:
Cook any salmon type fish, e.g. trout, in the microwave oven: 1 minute at high for every 100 grams. Remove skin, bones, tail and head, and let the meat cool. About 300 grams of meat should remain. 
Purée the trout meat together with cooked potatoes, freshly pressed lemon juice, cognac and molten butter in a food processor. 
Add the flesh of 1 1/2 peeled avocado, a very generous pinch of cayenne pepper and pinches of salt and black pepper. 
Purée for another 15-30 seconds. 
Transfer the mousse to a suitable bowl and let it cool for at least a few hours in the refrigerator. 
Serve the mousse together with lumpfish roe in canapés or on toast, using the remaining 1/2 avocado cut in thin slices as a decor.
An alternative is to take the mousse bowl, sit down upon a bed and spoon-feed each other. In this case the roe should be excluded.

Notes:
This dish can be prepared even a day in advance and be kept in the refrigerator until required. The texture makes it very well suited for spoon-feeding (each other).
