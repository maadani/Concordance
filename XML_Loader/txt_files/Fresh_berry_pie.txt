Ingredients:
3/4 cup ( up to 1 cup, 175 to 250 mL) granulated sugar 
1/4 cup ( 50 mL) all-purpose flour 
1/2 tsp ( 2 mL) grated lemon peel 
1/2 tsp ( 2 ml) ground nutmeg 
salt 
5 cups ( 1.25 L) fresh raspberries or blueberries, 
     or 2 (300-g) pkgs frozen unsweetened berries (do not defrost) 
1 Pastry for a 2-crust (9-inch/23-cm) pie 
1 tsp ( 5 mL) lemon juice 
1 tbsp ( 15 mL) butter 

Instructions:
1. Measure sugar, flour, peel, nutmeg and salt into a large mixing bowl. Stir with a fork until blended. Measure out berries, but do not add to sugar mixture. 

2. Preheat oven to 450F (230C). Using a rolling pin, roll out half of pastry on a lightly floured surface so it is no more than 1/8 inch (0.25 cm) thick. Line a 9-inch (23-cm) pie plate. Do not prick bottom. Roll out top crust. 

3. Just before baking, gently stir fresh or frozen berries into sugar mixture until coated. Turn into pastry-lined pie plate. Sprinkle with lemon juice and dot with little bits of butter. Cover with top crust. Seal and flute edges. Slash top in several places. Place on a baking sheet to catch any drips. Bake on bottom rack of 450F (230C) oven just until pastry edges become golden-tipped, about 10 to 12 minutes. Then, reduce heat to 350F (180C) and continue baking until crust is golden and fruit is bubbly, about 40 to 45 more minutes for fresh berries or up to 60 minutes for frozen berries. Place on a rack to cool before slicing. Pie tastes best the same day it's baked.

Notes:
For this irresistible summer pie, Dolores Hind uses raspberries grown on her farm, Hindsite. She always tastes a berry before adding the sugar. If it's nice and sweet, she stirs in only 3/4 cup of sugar.
