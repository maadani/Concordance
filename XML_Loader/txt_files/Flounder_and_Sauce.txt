Ingredients 
2 tsp (10 ml) olive oil 
1 tsp (5 ml) butter 
4 cloves crushed fresh garlic 
2 chopped tomatoes 
1 tbsp (15 ml) capers 
1 large bunch of arugula or basil (1 cup (225 ml) washed) 
salt and pepper to taste 
3/4 cup (175 ml) chicken broth 
juice of 1 large lemon 
8 filets of flounder. 
If you cannot get arugula or basil, use asparagus, or whatever green you like. Find something in the frige. 

Instructions:
Preparation 
In a large sauce pan, heat oil and butter until melted. 
Add garlic and saute until garlic is softened. 
Add the remaining ingredients and cook for about 4 minutes on a low simmer, until arugula is wilted. 
Pour over the fish and bake for about 20 to 25 minutes at 420 degrees (225 C.). 
It is easy and everyone loves it. 
Comments 
I had a lunch with a sauce over the fish that was like this one. I went home and made a similar one, but added some extra ingredients. 
The sauce is really good over any seafood.
