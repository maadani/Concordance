Ingredients:
1 c Butter 
1 c Caster sugar 
1 t Vanilla essence
3 Eggs
5 c Plain flour 
3 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon 
1/4 ts Ground cloves 
1/4 c Milk 
1/2 c Toasted sesame seeds

Instructions:
Cream butter and sugar with vanilla essence until light and fluffy. Beat eggs, reserve 1 tablespoon for glazing and add remainder gradually to butter mixture, beating well. Sift dry ingredients twice. Stir into creamed mixture alternately with milk to form a soft dough. Knead lightly until smooth. If dough is sticky, chill for 1 hour. Scatter some sesame seeds lightly on one side of pastry board. Shape pieces of dough into thick pencil shapes and roll onto the sesame seeds to coat lightly or according to taste. Double over rolled dough and twist, or form into rings, figure eights or coils. Place on greased baking sheets and glaze with reserved egg beaten with a little milk. Bake in a moderate oven for 15-20 minutes until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack and store in an airtight container. Variation: Roll dough in granulated sugar instead of seeds. Glaze lightly with milk.
