Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups flour 
1/2 tsp. salt 
2 eggs 
1/2 cup water 
3 cups mashed potatoes (nothing but salt added) 
2 Tbsp. butter 
1/2 pound grated cheddar cheese 
(You may omit cheese and add minced onion to taste or use both. I prefer both.) 
Instructions:
Sift flour. Add salt, eggs and water to make soft dough. Do not over handle. Let rest approximately 1 hour. Meanwhile, mix thoroughly, the butter and cheese with the potatoes. Let mixture cool (it will be the filling). Roll dough on floured board, cut into 2 inch squares and place 1 tsp. full on each square. Fold in half to form a triangle, pinch edges securely. Drop into boiling water until Pirogi comes to the top of the water (about 10 minutes). Saute in butter and minced onions. Ready to serve with some of the butter and onions.
