Notes:
I saw this in Bon Appetit yesterday and decided to keep it. I'll bet a dollar to a doughnut that the recipe originally called for Linguica, but was changed to kielbasa for the masses. If you can't find smoked Linguica or Kielbasa, Andouille would also be a good substitute. I hope to try this when it gets cooler (like October -- grin)! Hope it appeals to you, too.
