Ingredients: 
100 g pine nuts 
3 egg yolks 
250 ml chicken bouillon 
250 ml cream 
saffron, ouzo or cayenne pepper 
Instructions:
Proceed as follows:
Pur√©e a mixture of the pine nuts and the egg yolks in the food processor until you have a fine, smooth paste. 
Put this in a saucepan and add one cup of chicken bouillon and one cup of cream. The chicken stock can be added already at the food processor stage if you have difficulties in obtaining a smooth paste.This far the dish can be prepared hours in advance. 
Heat over a gentle fire under constant stirring until the mixture thickens. It must not, however, be brought to a boil! 
Serve immediately. 
If desired, the aphrodisiac properties can be reinforced by suitable spices. I have tried three equally successful alternatives: 0.5 grams of finely divided saffron, two tablespoons of ouzo and a pinch of cayenne pepper. The spice (but only one of them!) is added before the soup is heated. Especially the saffron gives the dish a pleasing reddish colour.

Notes:
A word of warning:
Be careful when deciding when to serve this delicious, very rich soup. I serve it with pleasure to my wife but never when we have couples as dinner guests.
