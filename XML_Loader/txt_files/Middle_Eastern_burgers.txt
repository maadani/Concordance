Ingredients:
1 lb ( 500 g) ground beef or lamb or a mixture of both 
1 onion, very finely chopped  
1/2 cup ( 125 mL) finely chopped fresh parsley or coriander 
1 tsp ( 5 mL) ground cumin 
1/2 tsp ( 2 mL) ground coriander 
1/2 tsp ( 2 mL) paprika 
1/2 tsp ( 2 mL) salt 
1/4 tsp ( 1 mL) cayenne pepper 
1 egg, beaten 
1/2 head romaine lettuce 
1 large tomato 
1/4 English cucumber 
4 pitas 
1 dollop of tzatziki sauce (optional) 

Instructions:
1. Preheat barbecue and lightly oil grill. Place meat in a bowl. Sprinkle with onion, parsley, and seasonings. Pour in beaten egg. Work meat mixture until ingredients are distributed. Divide into 8 oblong burgers about 1/2 inch (1 cm) thick. Use right away or cover and refrigerate for up to 1 day. 

2. Grill burgers until golden, about 4 minutes per side for medium-well. Meanwhile, shred lettuce and chop tomato and cucumber. Grill pitas about 1 minute per side, then slice 1 end open. Stuff 2 burgers into each pita and top with lettuce, tomato and cucumber. Add a dollop of tzatziki or drizzle with harissa or tahini sauces, if you like.
