Ingredients: 

3  Large onions* 
8  Whole allspice 
  Salt and pepper 
  Garlic powder 
  Hungarian paprika 

5,6 lb brisket; 1st cut

 *Sliced paper thin (3 is not a typo)
Instructions:
Remove any excess fat from brisket, but leave a little on top. Place one half of the onions on bottom of pan. Season the onions with a little salt, pepper, garlic powder and lots of Hungarian paprika. Place brisket on top of onions, then other half of onions and allspice on top of the brisket. Cover and roast in a 300 degree F. oven for 3 hours. Test your brisket and when it is fork tender, take it out. Let it cool and then slice it very thin. Strain juice and either thicken it with a little cornstarch or serve it au jus. You will have a very dark brown juice. NOTE: Best when made one day in advance. Aunt Sadie almost always served this with savory noodle kugel. I also serve it with roasted, boiled or mashed potatoes. Use a good roasting pan with a lit that fits well or covered with heavy duty aluminum foil. Spray pan and inside of lid with Pam.
