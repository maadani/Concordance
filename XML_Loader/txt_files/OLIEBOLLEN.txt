Ingredients:
1 Cake yeast (2/3 oz)
1 Cup Milk
2 1/4 Cups Flour
1 Egg
1 1/2 Cups Currants and Raisins
1 Tart (Cooking) Apple Fat for Deep Frying
2 tsp Salt

Instructions:
First blend the yeast with a little lukewarm milk. Sift the flour and salt. Add Milk, mix to a batter with yeast and egg. Add currants, raisins, and peeled, minced apple. Leave batter in a warm place to rise to double its size. Heat the fat to 375 degrees F. Put two metal spoons into the batter. Shape balls with the two spoons and drop them into the fat. Fry them for 8 minutes until brown. The doughnuts should be soft and should not be grease-soaked inside. If they are fried to slowly the crust becomes hard and tough and the doughnuts become greasy. Drain on absorbent paper. Serve then piled on a dish and thickly with sifted confectioner's sugar. Eat while hot if possible.
