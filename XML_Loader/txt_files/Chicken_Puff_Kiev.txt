Ingredients:
90g (3oz) unsalted butter 
1 clove garlic, crushed 
2 shallots, chopped 
1 Tbsp parsley, chopped 
2 tsp Worchestershire sauce 
1/4 tsp black pepper 
4 whole chicken breasts, skinned and boned 
2 sheets ready rolled puff pastry 
milk or cream for glazing
Instructions:
Cream the butter, garlic, shallots, parsley, Worchestershire sauce and pepper together and shape into a 28cm (11") oblong. Wrap in foil and freeze until firm. Pound out chicken breasts until very thin with a meat mallet or rolling pin. Cut frozen butter mixture into 4 equal portions. Place 1 portion in the center of each chicken breast and fold chicken over butter so that it is completely encased and makes a roll shape. Cut pastry sheets in half and place a chicken roll on each strip of pastry. Roll up firmly. Place seamside down on a greased baking sheet. Glaze with milk or cream and bake at 230C (450F) for 20-25 minutes or until pastry is golden brown.
