Ingredients:
Ingredients: 
300 grams of (mixed) fish fillets of white, firm meat 
1 fish bouillon cube or 1 tbsp of fish bouillon powder 
250 ml dry white wine 
1 tbsp butter 
25-50 grams beurre manié (a mixture of equal parts of all-purpose flour and butter) 
salt and pepper as required 
Instructions:
Proceed as follows:
Cut the fish fillets into inch-sized cubes and dip them into the flour-pepper-salt mixture. 
Prepare the bouillon from boullion cubes or powder but use white wine instead of water. 
Melt the butter in a pan. When the butter is slowly turning dark yellowish, fry the fish fillet cubes for one minute, then add the bouillon and let the fish cubes simmer for a few minutes. 
Remove the pan from the heat and decant the liquid into another pan. 
Bring the liquid to a boil and add small quantities of beurre manié while constantly stirring until you have a rather viscous sauce. Remove the pan from the heat and pour the sauce over the fish cubes in the first pan. 
Add salt and pepper as required. 
Heat briefly until the sauce is just about to begin boiling again, the remove the pan from the heat.

Notes:
We needed a good fish stew to serve as the basis for the "Tropical Fish Stew" we came across in Tanzania and developed this recipe. Virtually any fish with a firm, white meat can be used. If you use several different fishes, keep the cooking time required for each type in mind and add them in such an order that they will not be overcooked.
