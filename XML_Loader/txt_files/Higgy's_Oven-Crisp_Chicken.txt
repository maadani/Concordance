1 cup plain yogurt 
1 large clove garlic, pressed 
1 tablespoon hot pepper sauce (Tabasco)

1/3 cup cornmeal

2. In a large flat dish, combine yogurt, garlic and Tabasco. Lay chicken in mixture, coating well. Marinate for 1 hour at room temperature.
3. In a shallow dish, combine the flour, cornmeal, paprika, salt, and black and red pepper. Roll the chicken pieces in the breading mixture, covering all sides.
4. In a large roaster, generously oiled (with 1 1/2 tablespoons excess in bottom) place the chicken, meat side down.
