225g/ 8oz warm cooked potato
1/2 tsp salt
25g/ 1oz butter, melted
50g/ 2oz plain flour
Makes 8
Instructions:
Mash potatoes well. Add salt and butter, then work in enough flour to make a pliable dough. Divide the dough in two and rolll out on a floured surface to form two circles 22cm / 9 inch in diameter and 1/2cm/ 1/4 inch in thickness. Cut each circle into quarters and bake on a hot griddle or pan for about 5 minutes or until browned on both sides. Some people like to grease the baking surface, while others prefer a light dusting of flour for a drier effect.

Notes:
Also known as fadge or potato cake, this is delicious hot from the griddle or pan with melted butter and a sprinkling of sugar. It is also a much-loved part of a traditional breakfast.
