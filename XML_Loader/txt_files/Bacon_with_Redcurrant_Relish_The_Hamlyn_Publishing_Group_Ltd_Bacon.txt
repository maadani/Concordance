Ingredients:
1 pound boil-in-the-bag bacon piece 
4 ounces redcurrants 
1 tablespoon sugar 
1 teaspoon ground allspice 
2 drops tabasco sauce or 1 teaspoon ground chilies 
2 teaspoons arrowroot 
  Salt 

Instructions:
Cook the bacon as instructed on the packet. Meanwhile, remove the stalks from the redcurrants and put the fruit in a small pan with 1/4 pint cold water, the sugar, allspice and tabasco sauce or chili powder. Heat gently to dissolve the sugar, then simmer until the fruit is soft but not broken. Blend the arrowroot with a little cold water to make a paste and pour a little of the redcurrant mixture into it. Stir well and return to the pan. Bring to the boil, stirring, until the sauce thickens and becomes clear. Season with salt. Remove the bacon from the pan, cut it into 8 slices and arrange them quickly on a hot serving dish. Spoon the sauce in the center. Serve with 3 ounces broad beans per person and potatoes
