3 tb Thai tea (cha thai) 
6 oz Boiling water 

Sugar or: 
Sweetened Condensed Milk to taste

Instructions:
1. Place tea in a coffee filter in a drip cone. Preheat carafe with boiling water; discard water. Pour 6 ounces boiling water per serving into cone and let it drip through. Transfer brew to another container, then pour back through filter. Repeat until tea is deep red in color, a total of 4 to 6 times. 
2. Sweeten tea to taste with sugar or condensed milk. Fill tall glasses with ice cubes and add tea to fill glasses halfway. Add milk or half-and-half and stir. 
Variation: The tea may be brewed in a teapot, but it will still need to be filtered through a paper filter or a very fine nylon strainer. Preheat pot with boiling water and allow to steep 6 to 8 minutes before straining.
