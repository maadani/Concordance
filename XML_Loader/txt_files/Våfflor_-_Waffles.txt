Ingredients: 
250 ml water (ice cold!) 
200 g all-purpose flour (325 ml) 
a pinch of salt 
400 ml heavy or whipping cream 
melted butter 
Instructions:
Proceed as follows:
In a large mixing bowl, toss together the flour, the water and the salt until you have a smooth mixture. 
Whip the cream until it is firm and mix it carefully with the water-flour mixture. 
Pre-heat a waffle iron (yes, unfortunately you do need a special iron; we have not been able to find a good substitute) and grease it lightly. 
Pour 100 ml of the batter onto the waffle iron and cook until crisp and golden (approximately 2 minutes). 
Serve immediately together with whipped cream and a suitable fruit or berry jam. Some even like to sweeten the waffles with some granulated sugar.

Notes:
In Sweden waffles are tradionally eaten on 25 March, Annuncation Day or, in Swedish, Vårfrudagen. They are also very popular in Swedish mountain resorts, where they generally are served together with whipped cream and cloudberry jam
