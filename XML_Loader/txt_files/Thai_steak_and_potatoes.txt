Ingredients:
4 baking potatoes 
2 large rib eye steaks, at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick, about a total of 1-1/2 lbs (750g) 
2 tbsp ( 30 mL) dark sesame oil 
2 tbsp ( 30 mL) soy sauce 
1 tbsp ( 15 mL) chili-garlic sauce 

Instructions:
1. Poke several holes in unpeeled potatoes. Place on a paper towel in microwave. Microwave, uncovered, on high until partly softened, from 12 to 14 minutes. Or place in a preheated 400 F (200 C) oven for 20 minutes. Cut in half lengthwise and lightly score cut surface. Oil grill and preheat barbecue. Trim and discard any thick fat on steaks. 

2. Brush potatoes all over with sesame oil. Season potatoes with salt and pepper, if you wish. Place on barbecue. Grill, turning occasionally until lightly golden, from 10 to 15 minutes. 

3. Stir remaining sesame oil with soy sauce and chili-garlic sauce. Brush on both sides of steak. Place on grill with potatoes. Brushing often with sauce, grill until steaks are done as you like, from 6 to 8 minutes per side for medium. Continue to turn potatoes until fork-tender. 
Serves:
2
Notes:
The zing of chili-garlic sauce takes steak and potatoes way beyond its stodgy image.
