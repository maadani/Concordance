Ingredients:
4 store-bought frozen sirloin burgers or prepared burgers 
1/4 cup (50 mL) Italian or sun-dried tomato-and-oregano salad dressing 
2 ripe but firm tomatoes 
1/2 cup (125 mL) croutons, without seasoning or lightly seasoned 
1/4 cup (50 mL) crumbled feta or chÃ¨vre 
Instructions:
Grease grill and preheat barbecue to medium-high. Brush burgers with dressing and place on grill. Barbecue until no pink remains in centre of burgers, at least 5 to 6 min. per side. Meanwhile, slice tomatoes in half. Scoop out and save pulp. Brush tomatoes with dressing. Place cut-side down on grill until grill marks form, about 3 min. Meanwhile, discard seeds from pulp. Chop pulp and place in a bowl. Coarsely crush croutons, then stir into pulp, along with feta and 1 tbsp (15 mL) dressing. Add more dressing, if needed, 1 tsp (5 mL) at a time. Remove tomatoes from grill and fill with crouton mixture. Return to grill, filled-side up. Continue to cook until bottom of tomatoes have grill marks, about 3 min. For a golden topping, place tomatoes on a baking sheet and broil until cheese is golden, about 3 min. Makes 4 servings
