Ingredients:
8 oz Flour 
1/2 ts Salt 
2 oz Margarine 
1 tb Olive oil 
1 tb Milk, plus extra 
1 tb Water 
1 Egg 
Sesame seeds 
Instructions:
Put the flour and salt in a large bowl and make a hole in the middle. Into this hole pour the melted marg, olive oil, milk, water and beaten egg. 
Stirring from the outside into the middle gradually mix all the liquids into the flour until you have a dough. It will feel a bit oily, but is quite manageable. With floured hands shape the dough into rings about the diameter of a saucer and arrange them on a baking sheet. Brush them over with milk and sprinkle the sesame seeds on them. Bake them in a 400 degree oven for approx. 30 min. or until they are nicely browned.
