Notes:
This pasta along with All'Amatriciana and their variations are favorites in Roman trattorias. All'Amatriciana , with little pieces of cured pork in the sauce, comes from the Abruzzese town of Amatrice. So do many of the hosts of the old Roman trattorias, Osterias, and tavole calde, where Romans take their meals, and so all'amatriciana has become a Roman style of pasta.Penne all'arrabbiata, without the cured pork, simply means "enraged pasta," referring to the heat of the peppers, which are also valuable for restoring flagging energies, see the puttanesca recipe. The popularity of these pastas has benefited considerably from the nostalgie de la boue that from time to time afflicts upper-class Romans, intellectuals, film people, and aristocrats, who frequent working-class eating places at times of the night when the working classes are soundly asleep-a bit like Parisian partygoers slumming for bowls of soupe a` l'oignon at five o'clock in the morning.
