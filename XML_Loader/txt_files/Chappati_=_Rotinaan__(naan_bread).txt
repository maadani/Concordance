Ingredients:
1 cup of flour (white)
1 tablespoon ghee (cow shortening)
1/2 tea sp or less salt
Instructions:
Melt ghee in a small frying pan DO NOT boil it.
Mix ghee with flour and salt.
Then mix with warm water (add just a little bit of water at a time and mix the dough thoroughly, make sure the dough is not hard) keep for at least one hour. Then separate dough into small rolls similar to oven cupcake buns. Use rolling pin and roll the dough balls each on a large flat surface (Formica counter top does great) as you roll the pin spread a little ghee on the dough and then tear the now flat pizza like dough spread from the center by pulling evenly to all edges and cut one side so you are left with a long lean piece of dough in your hands. Roll it into a coil (snakes) from each end in opposite directions (one clock wise and the other end counter clock wise) when they get together, then twist one of the collected coil and put it over the other. 
Clean area over the oven top and keep a wide flat heavy/thick frying pan on the cooking range, turn on the cooker at low. Leave the dough for about 10 minutes then roll with rolling pin on flat surface into an evenly spread round (pizza like) thin spread. Turn the heat on to medium using oiling brush, spread a little ghee evenly all around the pan and cook the chappatis. Keep turning (rotating it) to ensure even cooking and turn over and keep pressing after turning and also put ghee on top but not too much and keep on pressing in the frying pen until light brown.
