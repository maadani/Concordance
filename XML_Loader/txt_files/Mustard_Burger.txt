Ingredients: 
300 g minced veal 
200 g shallots 
2 eggs 
3 tbsp mustard (Dijon if possible) 
50 g capers 
olive oil 
salt and black pepper 
Instructions:
Proceed as follows:
Finely chop the shallots, e.g. using a food processor. Fry gently in olive oil in a frying pan until the shallot pieces have softened; they must not, however, turn brown. 
Mix the fried shallots with the minced veal, the eggs, the mustard, the capers and some salt and pepper in a bowl. 
Cover a plate with a thin film of olive oil. Transfer the meat mixture from the bowl to the plate and form it into an oversized burger with the same diameter as the frying pan. 
Let the burger slide from the plate into the heated frying pan. Fry for about 4 minutes. 
Remove the frying pan from the heat. Put the plate on top of it. Turn frying pan and plate upside down so that the burger will end up on the plate. Take another plate, cover it with a film of olive oil. put it on top of the plate with the burger, turn the two plates upside down. 
You should now have the burger on the second plate with the fried side up. Let it slide back into the frying pan. Fry the burger for another 4 minutes. 
Divide the burger in two halves and serve together with, e.g. mashed potatoes and a salad.

Notes:
The name of this dish can be somewhat misleading. Yes, it is a burger but oversized, large enough to feed two persons. Originally we made it from minced beef, but later found that using minced veal will make the burgers much juicier
