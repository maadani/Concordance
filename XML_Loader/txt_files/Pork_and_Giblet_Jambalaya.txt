Ingredients:
3 tbsp. cooking oil 
1 lb. lean pork, cut in 1" pieces 
1/2 lb. chicken giblets 
1 tsp. salt 
1/4 tsp. red pepper 
1 1/2 cups raw rice (long grain) 
3 cups water 
1 med. onion, chopped 
1 stick celery, chopped 
1 cup whole tomatoes, chopped, (use canned, drained well, if fresh unavailable) 
1 clove garlic, mashed 
2 tbsp. butter 
1/4 tsp. thyme 
1/4 tsp. oregano 
2 tbsp. green onion, chopped 
2 tbsp. parsley, chopped 
1/4 cup sherry (optional)
Instructions:
IN a large pot with a heavy bottom, combine pork, giblets, oil, salt and red pepper; cover with a tight fitting lid and cook over med. heat 1 1/2 to 2 hours until tender, stirring and adding water frequently to prevent sticking (just a little, this is evidently not the 3 cups of water given in the ingredients list.) Then add onion, garlic, and celery, cook about 5 minutes. Dish out meat and seasoning, reserve oil and drippings. Cut meat in small pieces ( or run it through a meat grinder). Set aside. 
To oil and drippings, add tomatoes, cook about 5 minutes, add rice and coat well, stirring. Then add 3 cups water and when the mixture comes to a boil, cover with a tight fitting lid (reduce heat) and cook about 25 minutes. (All liquid should be absorbed and rice tender.) Then add cooked meat mixture, butter, thyme and oregano. Cook 20 minutes longer; can stay covered till ready to serve, than add green onion, parsley and wine.

Notes:
The comments in parentheses are mine as this was a self-published cookbook that is still in print. Personally I would omit the sherry and probably add more onions, celery, and garlic, but I like my food on the spicy side.
