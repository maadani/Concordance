Instructions:
Preparation 
Crabcakes: 
Combine egg, mayonnaise and seasoning. 
Add crab and enough breadcrumbs to absorb excess moisture (not too much). 
Stir carefully to blend; mixture should be firm yet moist,and should hold together. 
Form about 6 patties, depending on your size preferences, and set on wax paper for a few minutes to dry slightly. 
Heat some oil in pan and pan-fry until golden on both sides (few minutes on each side is good). 
Serve with sauce. 
Sauce: 
Place seeded, deveined pepper sections under the broiler until charred black; discard skin. 
Dice peppers small and set aside. 
Heat 1 tbsp (15 ml). butter over medium heat and saute mushrooms, shallots and thyme for about 2 min. 
Add wine, vinegar and stock and cook until liquids reduce by half - about ten minutes. 
Stir in cream and reduce by half - about five minutes. 
Over low heat, whisk in remaining butter, gradually, piece by piece - creating an emulsion. 
Strain, if desired, and season with lemon juice, salt and pepper. 
And stir in the diced, roasted peppers and serve warm. 
serve or if you prefer, you may puree sauce in blender.
