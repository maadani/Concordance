Ingredients:
Scone dough
340g/120z plain flour
1tsp baking soda
pinch salt
50g/ 2oz caster sugar
80g/30z butter
1 egg
175ml/l6fl oz buttermilk

Filling
700g/1lb rhubarb, roughly chopped
200-250g/7-9oz sugar
white of 1 egg, whisked
caster sugar to dust 

Instructions:
Preheat oven to gas mark 4, 180°C, 350°F, and grease a 25cm/10 inch deep pie dish. Sieve flour, baking soda and salt into a mixing bowl. Add caster sugar and rub in butter. In a separate bowl, beat the egg together with the buttermilk and gradually add this to the flour until a dough is formed. Knead lightly on a floured surface and divide dough into two. Roll out one half and use it to line the pie dish. Fill the dish with the rhubarb and sprinkle with the sugar. Roll out the remaining dough to form a pastry lid. Brush the rim of the pastry base with water and put on the lid. Glaze with the whisked egg white and sprinkle with caster sugar. Make steam slits in the lid and bake for 50-60 minutes or until the crust is lightly browned and the fruit is soft. This pie is also delicious if made with apples.

Notes:
Both my parents ate this as children, dished straight out of the oven. The fruit and sugar would boil out around the sides, resulting in the gooey, syrupy cake they remember as a heavenly treat. The scone dough is quicker to make than pastry and absorbs the lovely juices better.
