Saute' the onion, and meat in a frying pan until browned, draining off any excess fat. Add the beef stock, tomato sauce and seasoning, cover, bring to a boil, then simmer for 15 minutes. Stir in the blended flour, and allow the mixture to thicken then cool. Lightly grease a 23cm (9") deep pie dish and line with the shortcrust pastry. Spoon in the cool filling, moisten the edges with water, and top with the puff pastry, pressing gently to seal. Trim and score the edges, brush the top lightly with a beaten egg and make a slight cut in the center of the pastry.
