Comments 
My family actually prefers using Milk Chocolate Chips instead of semi-sweet. The key to making the fudge creamy and keeping it from becoming grainy, is boiling it for the exact time mentioned while stirring constantly. 
This is the same recipe they use at See's Candy Stores. It is creamy and delicious.
