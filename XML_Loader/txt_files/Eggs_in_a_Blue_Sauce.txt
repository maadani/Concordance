Ingredients: 
3 hard-boiled eggs (shelled!) 
1 tbsp butter 
1 tbsp flour 
200 ml white wine 
an additional 10 grams of butter 
a few drops of white wine in which you have dissolved a small quantity of methylene blue 
finely chopped parsley or dill 

Instructions:
Proceed as follows:
Melt the butter in a casserole at low heat, add the flour while stirring and then the wine. Let the mixture simmer at low heat for 20 minutes. 
Add salt and pepper, an additional 10 grams of butter and the methylene blue, dissolved in white wine. 
Pour the sauce over the hard-boiled eggs and sprinkle the dish with parsley or dill. 
A slightly more "Swedish" version (blue-and-yellow) can be obtained by dividing the eggs in two halves and pouring the blue sauce carefully around the halves.

Notes:
This mildly exotic recipe is contained in the "Honeymoon Cookbook", which the Swedish "Kooperativa FÃ¶rbundet" distributed to all newlyweds during the 1930's. Do not worry, the acute toxicity of methylene blue is low.
