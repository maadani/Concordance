Ingredients:
1 lb Fresh Squids. 
1 tb Lemongrass, Sliced Fine. 
3 tb Lime or Lemon Juice. 
1 tb Scallions, Chopped. 
1/2 c Mint Leaves. 
1 tb Fresh Ginger Root, Julienne. 
2 tb Onion, Chopped. 
3 tb Fish Sauce. 
1 tb Cilantro, Chopped. 
10 Crushed Hot Chili Peppers. 
Instructions:
Clean and wash the fresh squids, removing all inner matters and skin. Cut through the side so that the meat is in a single "sheet". Cut the meat into strips about 3/4" to 1" wide and 2" long. If desired, slash one side in a close criss-cross patterns, and the strip will curl into a roll upon cooking. Place the squid pieces into a wire strainer with long handle.
Boil a pot of water, and immerse the strainer with the squid meat into the boiling water to cook. For very fresh squid, cook until the meat had turned opaque and heated through. For frozen, or "not so fresh" squid, it is advisable to cook a little longer. Lift the squid out of the boiling water and let drain in the strainer.
Place the well drained squid meat into a bowl and add fish sauce and lime or lemon juice. Adjust tastes by adding more of either ingredients. The tastes should be tangy sour with sufficient salty tastes. Add lemongrass, ginger roots (very finely julienne), and chopped onions, and mix well. (Optionally, you may add dry ground hot chilli pepper to taste).
Place on a serving platter (lined with lettuce leaves) and topped with chopped scallions, cilantro, mint leaves, and crushed hot chilli peppers
