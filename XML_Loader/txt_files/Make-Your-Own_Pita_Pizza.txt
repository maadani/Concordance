Name:
Make-Your-Own Pita Pizza
Type:
Pizza
Country:
USA
Author:

Ingredients:
For each individual pizza you will need:   
7 inch pita bread (Greek-style, if available) 
1/4 cup spaghetti sauce 
1/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese 
Other toppings: thinly sliced pepperoni, sliced mushrooms, chopped green pepper, chopped onion, pineapple tidbits, etc. 

Instructions:
For each pizza, place a whole pita bread on a baking sheet and spread generously with spaghetti sauce. Greek-style (pocketless) pitas are a bit thicker and make a spongier crust. Sprinkle the sauce with whatever toppings you like, and finish off with the shredded mozzarella cheese.
Bake pizzas at 425 degrees for 8 to 10 minutes, until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Slide finished pizza onto a plate and cut into wedges with a pizza wheel or knife.
