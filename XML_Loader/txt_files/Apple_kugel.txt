1  Egg 
4 tb Warm water

Instructions:
Dough: Sift dry ingredients together. Add oil and egg, and water to bind. Turn out on a floured board. Knead until smooth and spongy. Set in a bowl, sprinkle with flour, cover with plastic wrap, and chill
30 minutes. Filling: Combine dry ingredients in a bowl, sprinkling lemon juice over apples to prevent discoloration. Roll dough very thin. Brush with oil. Spread apple mixture along long end, and roll as for jelly roll. Place roll in a greased utility pan. Brush top with beaten egg. Bake at 350F (180C) until brown. Baste with orange juice if apples are not juicy enough.
