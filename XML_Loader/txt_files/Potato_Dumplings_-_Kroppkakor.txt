Ingredients: 
1 kg cooked potatoes 
2 egg yolks 
1 1/4 cup all purpose flour 
1 onion 
100 g smoked ham 
100 g bacon 
salt, pepper 

Instructions:
Proceed as follows:
Mash the potatoes. Put it on a breadboard and make a small pit in the middle. 
Put eggs, flour and salt in the pit and work the potato-dough fast together. Too much kneading makes the potato tough. 
Chop finely the onion, cut the bacon and ham into small pieces and fry it until it gets coloured. Flavour it with white pepper. 
Form the potato-dough to a thick roll. Cut it in thick slices and put a pile of bacon mix in a pit in a slice, then put another slice on top of it, press the edges together and roll it to a ball. 
Lower the balls in boiling salted water and boil them approx. 10-12 minutes or until they float to the surface. Pick them up with a perforated ladle and put them on a hot serving plate. Don’t boil too many at a time, they will then have some difficulty to float to the surface. 
Serve hot with melted butter and red whortleberry (lingonberry) jam or cranberry jam.

Notes:
There are many forms of potato dumplings in Sweden and we strongly dislike them all. However, many have asked for recipes. "Kroppkakor" is especially popular on "Öland", a Baltic Sea island just outside the Swedish east coast
