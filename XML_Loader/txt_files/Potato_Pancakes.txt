Ingredients: 

2 lb Potatoes, medium 
2 md Onions, peeled 
2 lg Eggs, well beaten 
3 lg Tablespoons flour, cracker 
  -meal, potato flour or 
  -matzo meal 
2 ts Baking powder 

Instructions:
1. Pare potatoes; let soak in bowl of ice water for 2 or 3 hours, drain.
2. Using fine grating disk of food processor, or the finest side of a four sided grater, grate potatoes into a medium bowl, grating the onions with the potatoes as you work. (The juice prevents the potatoes from darkening.)

3. Drain mixture through a large sieve set over a large bowl. Squeeze handfuls of the potato/onion mixture over sieve, allowing liquid to drain into the bowl. Let the liquid from the potatoes stand a few minutes to allow starch sediment to collect in the bottom of the bowl.

4. Meanwhile, mix the potato/onion mixture with the eggs, flour, baking powder, 1 teaspoon salt and dash of pepper. Add 1 tablespoon more flour, if needed to thicken mixture to consistancy of cooked cereal. Carefully pour or spoon off liquid from potatoes; add sediment only to the potato-egg mixture, stirring till just blended.

5. Preheat oven to 250 degrees F. In a 12" skillet, over medium high heat, heat 1/2" salad oil until hot but not smoking. Place heaping tablespoons of the potato mixture in the hot oil; with back of fork, flatten slightly. Fry about 5 pancakes at a time until golden, turning once, 3 minutes in all. Remove pancakes with slotted spoon; drain on paper towel lined baking sheet. Place in oven to keep warm while frying remaining pancakes. If desired serve pancakes with applesauce or sour cream.
