Ingredients:
2 carrots, chopped
2 celery stalks, chopped
1 large onion, chopped
2 qt chicken or turkey stock
2 lb black eyed peas
1 picnic ham w/bone, 3 to 4 lb
2 bay leaves
fresh oregano or basil to taste
fresh ground pepper to taste

Instructions:
Soak beans in cold water for 6-8 hours and drain.
Cut the ham into large chunks and combine all the
ingredients in a large pot. Top off with enough 
water to barely cover the ingredients. Cover pot
and simmer for 2-3 hours, stirring occasionally.
Remove the lid and simmer for 1 hour.

Can be served right away, but if you let it sit in
the refrigerator over night then reheat it, the flavor
intensifies.

Serve with hot cornbread and a glass of your 
favorite red wine. Enjoy!
